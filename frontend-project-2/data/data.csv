There should be other channels available for different types of guests. The beach is quite far from the villa and not easily accessible so maybe won't be best option for old aged guests.,Location was good. there is no breakfast included in this reservation.

I Paid extra for deluxe swim up pool room leading off my veranda but pool was freezing and not heated, very disappointed as the sun only hit the pool around 7am and by 9am onward it was in the shade and air temperature only 22c at that time so wasn't tempted to use my swim up pool and waste of extra money paid. Swim up room pools should be heated especially in winter month of January, February when air tempreture is chilly to use a cold unheated pool.

2. Only 2 pools heated out of 10 pools in the entire complex and small children were using the adult pools also. More pools should be heated so children can stay in their own pool and adults can be in other pools instead of the whole hotel guests adults and children trying to squeeze into only 2 adult heated pools whilst the other 8 pools were empty as too cold to enter.

3.Indoor heated pool in Spa area closed at 5pm? But should stay open until atleast 6.30pm as the spa is still open until 7pm and has staff in there. 
Maybe split the lifeguard shifts so they have a lifeguard to cover until 7pm also in the indoor pool as sunset should not affect the indoor pool which has lights and is heated. 

4.

My husband and I stayed at the Nubian Palace for 2 nights! We had an amazing time staying at this beautiful resort-style nubian accomodation!! Let me start with the food. The food was DIVINE with amazing presentation and quite generous servings! My husband and I always shared one meal as it’s huge!! Their food was probably the BEST one we’ve tried in Egypt and we’ve already been to a lot of restaurants and hotels in Cairo, Luxor and Aswan! Next, the people. Probably the loveliest people in Egypt!!! We’ve had negative experiences as tourists when we were in Cairo and especially Luxor as most of the people we’ve encountered we’re too aggressive in terms of offering services at much higher prices, always expecting huge amounts of tips and asking for more and overcharging food, drinks and services. They will keep on physically following you even if you’ve already said No so many times. But the people in Nubian Palace have always been so sweet and accomodating, very relaxed and professional, they even packed us breakfasts without telling them to when we had to leave at 5am for our Abu Simbel tour and also on the day of our departure which was at 6am. Our room was also comfortable and cool because of the aircon with a nice view of the Nile river. They also provided generous amounts of toiletries in the bathroom and they are always accomodating to our requests. Their manager (I forgot his name), has always checked in on us if everything is alright. The photos that you see online are not enough, you have to be there to see it in person and feel the amazing relaxing vibes this accomodation gives!! Definitely the place to stay if you’re going to Nubian village!!!✨",1,"['style nubian accomodation', 'nubian village husband', 'cairo especially luxor', 'best resort', 'relaxing place stay']",[],[],[]

Luxor - later arrival, so missed dinner.","The food and alcohol was way better than expected. The guy who tirelessly cooks omelette every morning is a freakin legend and should get a salary raise.

Our recent stay at this resort was nothing short of amazing. Truly one of the best resorts we’ve experienced, and we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

Rooms & Facilities:
The rooms were spacious, spotless, and thoughtfully located in a quiet area away from families with children, ensuring a peaceful stay. We enjoyed breathtaking views of the Red Sea, lush gardens, and sparkling pools. The beautifully maintained gardens and common areas are a testament to the resort's attention to detail. The pools were always clean, and we especially appreciated the adults-only (16+) pool and beach area. A special shoutout to Mr. Hamdy for keeping our room immaculate and surprising us with fun towel animals daily. The only minor note is that I wasn’t used to their pillows, but it wasn’t a major issue.

Beach:
The private beach is a gem. It offers access to a pier leading to one of the most spectacular coral reefs we’ve ever seen, teeming with distinctive fish. Beach beds were always available, and the beach service was excellent, with fresh towels, a bar, and professional lifeguards. Special thanks to Walid and Sherif, who made us feel at home with their warmth, snorkeling tips, and good humor. Their diving and snorkeling recommendations were fantastic, and I only wish we’d had more days to explore underwater!
Spa:
We opted for the couples' treatment, including a private sauna, jacuzzi, hammam scrub, and massage. Josephine and Taghrid provided top-tier, personalized care, making the experience incredibly relaxing and memorable. Mansour was also instrumental in advising us on treatments and rearranging our massages to fit our schedule perfectly.

Restaurants:
Although I’m not usually a fan of buffets, the quality and variety of the food pleasantly surprised me. From soups and fresh salads to an array of meats and live cooking stations for pasta and barbecue, there was something for everyone.",-1,"['resorts ve', 'snorkeling recommendations fantastic', 'private beach', 'recommend rooms facilities', 'stay enjoyed breathtaking']","['exceptional', 'la carte', 'waterfall', 'available booking managed', 'grill indian']",['beach'],[]

They approached us daily, which became quite intrusive and detracted from the relaxation we were seeking. On several occasions, a massage therapist approached us, and we felt pressured into purchasing a massage just to stop the repeated offers. Unfortunately, we didn’t enjoy the massage experience. Once payment was made, they became less attentive and even tried to overcharge us by converting the cost from euros to dollars, resulting in a higher price than originally quoted. The spa staff was also rude, and there was a lack of communication. Although the massage itself was fine, I was left waiting for 20 minutes afterward with no indication that the session was over. Overall, we would not recommend the spa or any additional services at the hotel.

The room itself was well-prepared, although the furniture was a bit outdated. However, housekeeping was excellent, with daily cleanings that were thorough.

A special thank you to Ahmed Moawad, who took care of our room. He was incredibly helpful, provided us with everything we needed, and created beautiful towel figures for us. He was the kindest and most attentive staff member we encountered during our stay, and he truly made our experience better.

The hotel grounds include several pools, one of which was very warm. The sea was also warm, and the beach was comfortable and well-kept. There were both sandy areas and rockier sections, and towels were provided clean daily on the beach. There was a bar by the beach, another near the pool, and even food available close to the shore. Life jackets were available on the beach, and all necessary amenities, including toilets, were nearby. The water was clean and safe for swimming, with fish visible in the water, making for a nice view. The only downside was the long descent down to the beach.

We booked a room with an ocean view, which was truly beautiful. We were on an All-Inclusive plan, and the food was tasty and of good quality. We were satisfied with our meals, and the bar served a variety of drinks. There were also shops in the hotel where you could purchase cigarettes, snacks, and other essentials. Guests can also step out to the Soho area nearby, which is pleasant for evening strolls.

One minor inconvenience was that the pool and beach closed at 5 pm, which seemed a bit early.

This is not a regular hotel, there is these round shaped big bungalow structures that have 16 rooms each. At first it looks like you don't have alot of privacy, but this is actually the opposite.

The staff was very friendly, but very formal, as is usual for a Maritim franchise, but nothing really stood out to us except the staff from the Italian restaurant. There was this one man, whose name I forgot, who really loved his job and needs to get all the credits for the service. Besides that, the food was really really good as well, I even asked if there was an Italian cooking in the kitchen, but it was an Egyptian, big congrats to the kitchen 🙏🏽

But the biggest reason for us being this happy is the location. The whole resort is situated on it's own island, with extraordinary views of the nile. The sunset is stunning and it all felt like a dream. Also the infinity pool was one of the most beautiful I had ever seen.

Honest friendliness and professionalism at all levels characterize Hammam and thus also the name of Shellghada. I sincerely hope that this review will also be noticed at higher hierarchical levels. Thank you very much for, now for the second time, professional service. I will recommend the hotel and this will be my first choice for further business trips.

But I am only saying this as a small downside.","This was a New Year break for my family (children aged 14 and 16). we booked 2 rooms all inclusive.
The hotel communication beforehand was fantastic. 
when we checked in the staff were brilliant, best of all we were given a WIFI data box that we could use both in the hotel and out and about. Our teenagers were so happy and the wifi was perfect throughout the stay even when we took trips out (we had no data in egypt).
We were given 2 huge interconnecting rooms, 
The food was great even though my youngest is very fussy!
Breakfast, fresh omlette station and fresh pancakes. Bread rolls, warm food (beans / porridge / boiled eggs / cooked hot dogs), cheese and cold meat station, finally a 'cake' station with doughnuts, croissants and pastries (they were a little dry, but still nice)
Lunch, fresh pasta station and french fries. bread and salad bar. Rice (delicious!) with hot food like vegetable stew (i loved this) and various meat stews. almost always some sort of roast chicken or fish. Cake station with strangely coloured cakes which were odd looking (for British people), but were pretty delicious!
Dinner - very similar to lunch just different hot stews and there was often a bbq meat section. 
Basically there was always something for everyone. 
the drinks were the least varied, just squash/coke/sprite/fanta/tonic plus spirits. we did get a little bored of the same drinks. 
The service at the hotel was exceptional, the best I have ever experienced. Thank you Mahmoud Samv, Mohamed Shaban, Hossam and Ahmed (house keeping). Those are the names I have but Everyone deserves a mention. Smiles and amazing service.

Being the first time in Egypt with the family with two kids and unfortunately due to delays we arrived late at night and driving through the empty desert with driver you don't know, certain thoughts come to mind, which are natural, especially if you are a mother or father. I would recommend the hotel to put up even more signs starting from the Nubian village even further down so that the tourists know they are heading in the right direction. Maybe right at when the village ends. We did start seeing signs once we were a few minutes away from the resort in the empty desert, but I think more signs/directions are required. From the bottom of the village before you start heading up through the village and to the desert, it's about a 20 minute drive. The Google maps location IS NOT CORRECT! Google map takes you to the bottom of the resort. You need to go through the entire village and go through the desert above the town to get to the hotel. 
I will say, after the scary night arrival, the next morning having booked a tour and driving back the road we came from at night, it was surreal experience driving with those 3 wheel motorbikes (toktok they call them) back into the desert and through the village. The scenery is unbeatable. So if you happen to arrive in the day, you are not going to have the scary arrival experience we had of course.
It seems when we arrived it was a soft-opening. So not many guests were there and they did not have breakfast buffet. They did make us to-go boxes of breakfast since we had tours, but they did not have breakfast as indicated by the pictures. I believe they should have communicated this somehow before guests arrive so the guests know what to expect.",The resort is very beautiful and peaceful environment away from the city and noise. The views in the morning during sunshine are amazing and probably best you will see in Aswan. The attention to detail of the architecture is incredible and all share a story. We liked to read about all the different room names and their history. So you do learn a lot as well if that's what you are interested in. The infinity pool is amazing you feel you are on the edge of a cliff. Although it was a bit cold. But very relaxing after a long day tour. The food was the best we eat in Egypt as it is made very traditional by local Nubian people. The staff were very friendly and made you feel at home.

Although the beaches themselves are small, the sandy areas and design of the seafront is very good. Towel / pool attendants a little miserable at times and not as friendly as hoped - maybe room for improvement here. Jetty for accessing the sea swimming and snorkelling/diving just offshore with the diving centre right there too.

40+ degrees, but not as humid as Abu Dhabi/Dubai this time of year so more bearable especially in the evenings.

Tip: To get to the property, you have to take the south Elephantine Island/Koti side public ferry (5 mins, EGP 10 each way), and then a short walk across the island through the unpaved village, which is a bit of a maze. It was always a charming and peaceful stroll, even at night, and didn’t bother us. 

Mohammed can arrange boat transfers to Aswan as well, which are direct to and from the property (also takes about 5-10 minutes).

Oh, and make sure you turn on the water heater switch before you shower!","We had a wonderful time at the Basmatic Guest House. It’s a tranquil and rustic property on the south of Elephantine Island, overlooking the West Bank of the Nile. A very peaceful location, and also an easy walk to the Elephantine archaeological site & Aswan Museum on the island. The rooftop restaurant had lovely views of the Nile, making it feel like a true oasis.

But what makes it special is the manager – Mohammed took such great care of us and organised our trips to Philae (with one of his cousins, also called Mohammed, who was brilliant), Abu Simbel, and a 2-night Nile River Cruise for when we left Aswan.

The employee said he was was sick so he was sleeping. Respectfully, I don't think sick employees should be preparing food for guests especially during a pandemic.


We didn't mind the location being away from Aswan it was peaceful and quiet. but we didn't realize that the bridge to get from the main city to the guesthouse is ONE-WAY controlled by checkpoint. Every time we wasted atleast 30-60 minutes at the bridge waiting to cross, so that's like two hours of your day gone.

We stayed on Elaphantine Island then booked a ferry to this part of Aswan. Its closer to Philae and we had no idea how special it would be. The operator is a Nubian soul sister from the start. She was so warm and joyful. The place is smothered in touches of artistic expression. Then the room. A cozy room with private bathroom and a loft like bed which was so beautiful and romantic. We ate delicious food and chatted away with the staff over the Nile. This little village has camels and beaches and she arranged taxis for us which we paid through her so it was all handled perfectly. We even left for Abu Simbel super early, she had a cab waiting for us and though only one person was awake she had a little snack pack in bags for us to take on our 4 hour journey across the desert. Who does that without being asked? True Nubian love right there. The thoughtful care and joy easily makes this the number one secret in Aswan.

We went with our two daughters (6 and 9) in July/August for two weeks. The first thing we noticed was the water slides and pools are amazing and everywhere. So many water slides, and pools for every age. Queues for the slides were fine, sometimes no queuing, some times a minute or two if busy. Lifeguards were everywhere and did their job well. There was even a pool with a wave machine which did 20 minutes of waves a few times a day. You can even use the sister Aqua park hotel next door for free, which was great. The grounds are extremely well maintained, there are lovely gardens and lawns as you walk around the resort.
Food was fantastic, I was worried that the variety wouldn't be there after reading some reviews, but there was a great selection every day in the main restaurant, and with three restaurants around the complex with other cuisines. Outside the main restaurant, there was a bbq every night. Everything all-inclusive, nothing to pay for. Alcoholic drinks were great, I had the wine and beer and both were much better than some all-inclusive resorts I've been to! Cocktails were available as well on the all-inclusive tariff. No queues for the bar, and waiter service in the evening. Our waiter in the main restaurant, Mostafa, was a legend and looked after us really well! 
There is a free shuttle bus to the hotel beach, where you can see marine fish really close up. Our room cleaner (Mahmoud) was fantastic, our room was always spotless and he visited every day and made us peacocks and crocodiles and many other animals out of the towels which our children loved. We had wifi in our room with absolutely no problems. 

Reception service was great. They sorted out everything we needed and when I lost my key and got locked out. Big shout out to Ahmed, who oversaw all of the reception service and was fantastic throughout the holiday.
 Overall, it was a tremendous holiday, I would recommend it 100%!",1,"['drinks great', 'water slides pools', 'hotel', 'sister aqua park', 'inclusive holiday went']",[],['hotel'],[]

And the shower itself was really good.","We had a really amazing stay at nubian palace. The place has an amazing view from the terrace, where you can sit whenever you want and wont be urged to buy something or something like that. I also really liked how calm it was. The noises of the city are gone, so you can really relax after a day in the city or a busy sightseeing. I espacially want to thank Ahmed, who is always there, always smiling and providing just the nicest and best service ever. We really felt at home because of him. He also made sure we get a really nice boat driver, so ask him for this. The driver was chill, calm, provided tea and snacks for every single trip and didnt hassle even once. He even waited for us at every single destination so we wouldnt have to wait for him or call him. 

The Breakfast is AMAZING. We could never ever eat everything. There was egg, flat bread, a salad, a local kind of cheese, two nubian dips for the bread that you could also eat just by itself and fried potatos. 
They also make you water with lemons or other stuff in it, which is safe to drink. They say they detoxyfied it, i dont know exactly what they did but none of us ever got any problems from it and neither did any of the other guests.

For dinner we just stayed on the terrace, where they serve a variety of meals. A lot of guests from other houses came over every day for dinner so i am going to let that speak for itself.

The rooms are pretty, everything seems like you live in a smaller version of the village around the hotel and everybody has their own house. There is air conditioning in every room, the beds are comfortable and everything was clean. 

Over all i can really recommend to stay here and enjoy the amazing place.",-1,"['room beds comfortable', 'palace place', 'nice boat', 'wait breakfast amazing', 'recommend stay']","['enclosure floor', 'didnt really problem', 'built wall', 'gets wet', 'shower really good']","['breakfast', 'room']",['shower']

We were offered a free upgrade from a double room to junior suite because they felt we'd be more comfortable with more space since we were a family of 3 (with our 7-year-old son). The next day as I saw housekeeping cleaning the room across the hall, which was a full suite with seaview, I asked to move there and for a small fee I was able to upgrade to this beautiful (higher category) suite. We were very happy there and much appreciated the accommodating nature of the reception staff. The food in all of the buffet restaurants was very tasty and offered much variety, so everyone could find something they'd enjoy, even us vegetarians! The servers were also very nice and took good care of everyone. The hammam with steam bath, sauna, jacuzzi, and hot stones was lovely (although the pricing was more like in Europe!) and the massage was relaxing. The couple of pools which were heated were very nice, but many were unusable at this time of year (Feb) because they were much too cold. There were 3 waterpark areas, one for very small kids, which was heated, but the 2 areas with waterslides for bigger kids and adults were unfortunately so cold that almost no one used them. We were looking forward to the waterpark with our 7-year-old son, but that was maybe the only disappointment of our whole stay. We would recommend at least one of the 2 larger waterslide areas to be heated, so the bigger kids and adults could enjoy it. We were happy that snacks and drinks were available near one of the heated pools and drinks and ice cream were offered by the children's waterpark. At the beach, there were waiters coming around to offer drinks; coffee and cake were offered in the cappuccino bar in the afternoon; and fresh orange juice was offered all-day long nearby, so there was really the feeling that you were always looked after and every need fulfilled!",-1,"['children waterpark', 'hammam steam bath', 'reception staff food', 'beach waiters coming', 'suite felt comfortable']","['mentioned', 'kids adults enjoy', 'heated', 'parks', 'larger water']","['reception', 'beach', 'food', 'staff']",[]

The hotel is run by a very welcoming Franco-Egyptian couple and their family, and only opened a few months ago. The house and rooms are beautifully decorated and very spacious and comfortable. There is a roof terrace for views over the city, and a lovely courtyard downstairs where delicious Egyptian breakfast is served every morning, and which is also a lovely place to sit and read with a cup of tea. 
On request they also can serve a delicious homemade dinner, which we did one night and would recommend!
The hotel is on the West Bank, which feels a bit more relaxed and quiet than the East side, and is convenient for visiting Valley of the Kings, Hatshepsut etc. From the hotel it is easy to get to the east side by public ferry which drops you at Luxor Museum (or getting one of the many boatmen around to take you across) which only takes a few minutes and is a 5min walk. 
For any tips or questions the owners are very attentive and helpful - they sorted a taxi for us for a day to visit the West Bank sites and put together a good itinerary and tips of which tombs to visit etc, which all worked smoothly and was very reasonably priced. 
Would highly recommend the place to anyone, and we will definitely try and stay here again next time we are in Luxor!",1,"['city lovely', 'recommend place', 'kemet house', 'luxor museum getting', 'stayed nights hotel']",[],['hotel'],[]

Foam party only on a Wednesday. Wish they did it twice in the week as we missed it.,"What an absolute fantastic stay at Pickalbatros aqua park sharm el sheikh. From as soon as we arrived we were greeted with welcome drinks and a lovely welcoming by Abdullah and Abdulrahman. They organise our large family of 7 to be in rooms next to eachother and for our stay to be near the heated pool which was fabulous. 

Abdullah and Abdulrahman at reception were excellent from the start of our trip to the end. Our flight wasn’t until 8pm and check out was at 12 but we were able to continue to use facilities untill we needed to go as-long as we was out the room. 

Mahoud Hosny cleaned our room every day and greeted us with a smile every day. He was very pleasant and always was there to help if we needed anything extra. Everyday he would set up the bed differently and the kids loved it! They were so excited to see what he would create next. 

We will definitely visit again, but maybe in the hotter months so that we can go on all the water rides. Only some pools/slides were heated but we still went on the other water slides it was just very cold. Having access to Aqua Blue was great as they have more heated slides. 

Food was amazing, they have a huuuge variety and different things everyday. Ice cream was the best! Especially mango and vanilla! Kids constantly wanted more and more. Entertainment was good for adults. Kids entertainment wasn’t the best but there’s so much fun to have in the water.

The ferry across to the West Bank is only a five minute walk along the corniche. The Temple of Luxor and the Souk are easily walkable from the hotel, no need for a taxi or carriage. Karnak Temple is also walkable taking approximately 15 to 20 minutes along the corniche. It had been 12 years since we last stayed at the Eatabe and although some refurbishment had taken place the ambience of the hotel remained the same, comfortable, friendly and welcoming. Location, comfort and friendly staff are what made us come back. We were so pleased to meet up with members of staff we had interacted with over the years. Aly, guest relations, greeted us like family and made every effort to ensure our stay was like being at home. Gigi, Salwa. Manar, Mostafa, Islam and Shazly were very attentive to ensure our breakfasts were enjoyable.The buffet breakfast offers a wide choice for guests of different nationalities but don't expect a full English. Our room was as we remembered 12 years ago, comfortable, with a spectacular view of the Nile, busy corniche, and the Valley of The Kings. The hotel's garden and pool area is a relaxing oasis where you can enjoy the sun and take advantage of having lite bites in the poolside restaurant and drinks from the bar. Ehab, Zain and Noby took great care of us and we enjoyed time catching up with them. We had always felt secure staying at the hotel and we were very happy to see the health and safety measures, in place for visitors and guests, were still being maintained to a good standard. In our opinion our 7 day stay was value for money. To some the hotel may seem dated but its location, welcoming staff, comfortable ambience override such concerns.",1,"['valley kings hotel', 'stayed eatabe refurbishment', 'sights luxor located', 'friendly welcoming location', 'hotel remained comfortable']",[],"['location', 'hotel']",[]

On the plus side, it is served in an open-air area with a beautiful view and the amount is generous!
For people looking for fancy facilities and touristy surroundings, this is not your place.","Being away from tourist areas in Aswan was what we wanted. The guesthouse was on the West Bank of the Nile in a peaceful, bucolic setting (farming area, cows, goats, camels, donkeys). The room (107) we had was in the new wing so good shower, AC, etc. and the ceiling built in the Nubean style. At dawn, as the sun hits, the ceiling is illuminated like the night sky. Although far away, the busy Aswan world is only a short(and free) on-demand boat ride away. So we had access to restaurants across the way. Tomb of the Nobles is walkable, but I think the guesthouse would have taken us by boat if I asked. The facilities themselves reminded me of a beach resort in the Philippines, with views to die for and easy access to the Nile. Tables and chairs scattered about for breakfast and soft drinks. Sometimes they might have other meals available but check in the morning. 

The best part of the experience is the staff who were friendly and welcoming: Hossam, Sayid, and the two older boys named Mohammed. Of note: we picked up virus before coming to Aswan, and started showing symptoms there. Hossam personally escorted us to the “tourist” hospital Al-germaniya and stayed for three hours with us so he could accompany us back to guesthouse. We would not have managed the bureaucratic process without him. When we gave him bakhshish/tip, he absolutely refused it. 

Owner Taha had arranged for taxi to airport($15), which was not a bad price. Although you can only speak with Taha over the phone, don’t hesitate to ask Hossam to speak to him if you need anything. If you’re coming into Aswan late in the day, ask to be picked up from airport because the place is not easy to find.",-1,"['coming aswan', 'nile tables chairs', 'guesthouse managed bureaucratic', 'aswan wanted', 'tourist hospital al']","['air area beautiful', 'view generous', 'egyptian fare blame', 'guesthouse', 'breakfast typical']",['nile'],['breakfast']

The triple room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable. The views from the east-facing balcony were gorgeous at sunrise. The room had a great AC, a fridge (a pleasant surprise that should be listed in the room facilities!), and nice toiletries. The bathroom hairdryer was much appreciated.

The Egyptian breakfast was excellent. We enjoyed it in the restaurant one day and had it packed for an early tour on another day.

Our host, Mohammed, and his staff were super welcoming and took great care of us during our 4 day stay. Mohammed had us picked up at the ferry dock by a motor boat shuttle. The short boat ride to the guest house around sunset was breathtakingly beautiful. Captain Zeizu and his team took care of our large suitcases, so these didn’t turn out to be an issue at all. The views form the rooftop were beautiful and the vibe very peaceful. Watching the sunset and having breakfast here was our favorite. A very special thanks to Zeinab and Fatima for the delicious food. Mohammed also arranged several excursions for us, starting from a day trip to Abu Simbel over a visit to the Nubian village to a sunset Felucca ride.

Kids running around everywhere and even touching with their hands food items on the buffet. Perfect for families with kids and not so great for people looking for peace and relaxation.
- Customers taking loads of foods from restaurants (especially fruits) and loading them into their beach bags! No interference from staff! What an ugly scene!
- Maintenance issues with sink in the bathroom and shower. More attention is needed towards maintenance and upkeep
- Low quality meat (my mother could not tolerate red meat), and in my case fish and seafood (I could easily tell they were low quality frozen and farm raised).
- I guess any resort with water parks may find itself being distanced from high-end/mature customers and attracting more mass tourism that is based on families with kids. The Pickalbatros brand may need to focus more on establishing resorts in Sharm el Sheikh (other options) that are free of water parks and more appealing to high-end and mature adults.
- Promoting adult-like behavior to prevail among kids (especially girls)!! (dancing stages and disco-like - not proper for kids and not a healthy behavior as some little girls were acting/dancing in a very strange way). Not a good scene to have in public and amid curiously looking adults from all walks of life!","1. Staff friendliness and professionalism

She also was knowledgeable & shared rich history about Nubian life & culture.The Hibiscus tea Edrees prepared was some of the best we've ever tasted. The rooms were extremely clean & the beds/pillows were extra comfortable. We enjoyed interacting with many of the Nubian children throughout the village. We also had an opportunity to visit a local school, which made our experience more authentic. My son provided many gifts to some of the children he met & played with in the village. We experienced sailing in a felucca along the River Nile, while the sun & breeze kissed our skin. . We also had a chance to reconnect with some of our Nubian friends we met during our 2019 sojourn to Aswan. We love the colorful artistry on display throughout the hotel. We enjoyed a variety of nubian breakfasts prepared daily during our stay. We also met a nice family from Peru, that we became friendly with. We will definitely stay at Ekadolli Nubian Guesthouse during our next sojourn.

At night I would have preferred to leave the balcony door open as the air was cooler than the aircon in the room without being so dry.(There is a screen door to keep bugs out.) However, in the morning, the air smelled of burnt rubbish. Leaving the door open would make the whole room stink of smoke.

It can be a long wait to get a table, food and drink at peak dinner times (e.g. 7pm or 8pm). Also arranging for a table for larger groups (over 6 people) can be challenging for some of the venues. Best to try to coordinate the day prior.

Whilst not particularly far from the main tourist attractions (5km from Karnak temple) the area just outside the resort is not really suitable for walking.","I stayed in a deluxe room with balcony and it was massive. The room was tidy and had everything I needed including a fluffy robe, slippers, safe deposit box, heaps of hangers in the wardrobe plus lots of drawers to fully unpack the bag.
The fruit plate was a surprise treat. Chairs on the expansive balcony are also comfy.
Staff are friendly and helpful, particularly those at breakfast and around the pools. Reception are super accommodating too (Arranging for a 6 hour later check out was easy and inexpensive and sorting next day guides and transport).
The pools were a welcome respite after a day of experiencing the temples or tombs and decent for food and drinks service.
Once a week there is an outdoor dinner buffet and live music (looked like a wedding reception) and many of the restaurants onsite are closed. I quite enjoyed this (I didn't have the buffet, only drinks.), though you may wish to ask at reception and plan accordingly (e.g. if you have dietary considerations). 
Sabrine at the Wellness centre can do a great firm deep tissue massage.

However, I've looked at a couple other reviews and spoken with a couple of guests who were dissatisfied, so there are a few things I'd like to note: Egyptian beds typically are not fitted with a top sheet. If this is important to you, you can ask for one—there's no reason that this should be a problem. The bathrooms are, in my opinion, very comfortable, with reliable hot water. There are, however, no bathtubs and the showers are set up right next to the toilets. This is very normal for a good Egyptian bathroom. There is a tool (a massahah) in the bathroom for wiping down the floor after a shower. Because we feel vulnerable in bathrooms, differences that we're unaccustomed to can be uncomfortable, but these differences are things that are part of being in another country, and they really *can* be comfortable. Finally, if you're in a wheelchair or use a walker, you will likely find navigating this location very difficult.","I've stayed in Nile View before, so the only surprises were new developments to the property. Nile View is a friendly, familial atmosphere (almost all of the staff are extended family) with nice, clean rooms and really an amazing view. It's an incredibly peaceful place to stay, yet only a short distance from the bustle of central Aswan. From the guesthouse you can see Kitchener Island, Qubbat al-Hawa, the Tombs of the Nobles, the Monastery of Anba Hedra, and the Mausoleum of the Agha Khan. There's lots of good bird-watching. The kitchen produces very nice food with fresh ingredients—most of them grown on the island itself. The staff are laid-back, friendly, and nice to talk with. The guesthouse owns a couple boats, and there's always someone around who can give you a lift to the west bank or—if you don't want to walk to the ferry—to one of the Aswan docks. (I haven't been asked for specific sums of money for using the boat, and occasionally a captain has been surprised that I offered money, but you really should expect to pay for this—it's not part of the included hotel service.)",-1,"['nile', 'place stay', 'guesthouse owns couple', 'view incredibly peaceful', 'ferry aswan']","['beds typically', 'good egyptian', 'bathtubs showers', 'normal good egyptian', 'vulnerable bathrooms differences']","['nile', 'view']",[]

I ended up paying £80 for a massage that I didn't really want just to get the guy to go away, he was pressuring for over £200 for 3 massages. Only after you complain do they tell you that there is a Do Not Disturb flag you can use to be left alone, but sorry you shouldn't need that in the first place, people's space and privacy should be respected. The massage was fine but it was no cheaper than what I got at home and my therapist does a job better suited to my needs. I didn't get my 30 mins of free spa treatment that's part of the package, I was too sick at the time, I went to reschedule my appointment but the lady didn't understand me and kept asking for my token which I didn't have as I had handed it in when I made the appointment previously. I had been up all night with violent vomiting and diarrhoea after picking up some sort of bug from something I drank or ate at the resort (the pharmacist said it's pretty common in all resorts) so I had no energy to contest this and gave up. I did also have an over keen cleaner that I found myself trying to avoid; on the first day he came banging on my door at 5 in the afternoon wanting to clean my room, I guess it was to be seen to be cleaning it, not sure , but if I saw his cart in the hallway I would retreat back to the pool and wait for him to go, again the do not disturb tag is your friend.

It would have been nice to have a chair/stool to go with the desk in the room and to have a softer light option in the room, it was either full beam or a reading light with nothing in between.","It's beautiful inside the resort, super clean and being adult only it's really peaceful.

The staff, they're almost all pretty good but there really are some standouts that really take pride and a joy in their job. Someone who served you at breakfast is the same person who serves you at dinner and then again the next day, incredibly hardworking people. It was nice that you do get checked on by the front of house team via WhatsApp and they'll do their best to fix any issues you have quickly.

I recently stayed at the Grand Resort, and it was an absolutely amazing experience from start to finish! The staff were exceptional and took great care of us, ensuring we had everything we needed throughout our stay. Whether it was assisting with our room or recommending activities, their attention to detail made us feel truly valued.

The food was another highlight of the trip. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner were all delicious, with a wide variety of dishes to choose from. The resort boasts 11 restaurants, and we especially loved the buffet – it offered such an incredible range of options that there was always something to please everyone.

The resort itself is enormous, almost like Trafford Centre in Manchester, with plenty to explore and enjoy. One of the best features was its convenient access to a beautiful beach, making it so easy to spend time by the sea. The surrounding roads felt very safe, which made getting around stress-free.

We used Uber for transportation, which was incredibly affordable – most journeys cost us around £1 each! It was very convenient for exploring nearby areas without any hassle.

The Grand Resort exceeded all our expectations. If you’re looking for a luxurious stay with great food, exceptional service, and a safe, accessible location, this is the place to go. Highly recommended!",1,"['food highlight trip', 'room recommending', 'resort boasts 11', 'resort exceeded expectations', 'stayed grand']",[],"['food', 'room']",[]

The views of the Nile River are breathtaking—whether you're relaxing by the pool or enjoying a quiet moment on your balcony, the scenery is just magical. HIGHLY recommend taking a walk around the property at night for some gorgeous photography.

The food here is outstanding! The dishes were delicious, flavorful, and beautifully presented. We particularly loved the local dishes that showcased the unique flavors that reflect the local cuisine. Their Nubian Chicken Tajine was beyond perfection!

The staff at Kato Dool Wellness Resort were incredibly friendly and welcoming. From the moment we arrived, we felt right at home. They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. They even called in a local pharmacy doctor for us when we needed one.

If you're looking for a place to unwind away from regular Aswan in a unique part of the city, enjoy delicious food, and soak in the beauty of the Nile, Kato Dool Wellness Resort is the perfect destination!

From the moment we arrived, the team went above and beyond to ensure our stay was exceptional.
Special Thanks to Tamer and the Front Office Team: A special mention goes to Tamer and his team in front office management. They were incredibly professional and attentive, ensuring every need of ours was met. My mum turned 74 during our stay, and they arranged an amazingly decorated table for her, even offering to invite any guests we had. This thoughtful gesture made her birthday truly special. We had a brilliant start to our New Year at Grand Oasis. Unlike other hotels that suggested charging us for the New Year's event, Grand Oasis did not. Instead, they made sure we had allocated seats and goodies ready for us. We were spoiled with scrumptious food, a large and amazing variety of fruits (which we love), free-flowing drinks, and, most importantly, a very warm welcome. Tamer's dedication to ensuring our comfort was evident in how he handled a few ad-hoc requests, especially concerning my mum's low mobility. His professional nature and commitment to getting everything right, along with confirming our satisfaction, were truly commendable.
We would also like to thank Omar and his team in housekeeping for maintaining high cleanliness standards. They ensured everything was spotless and comfortable for us.
Grand Oasis is conveniently located around an 8-minute drive from the international airport, making transfers and our day trip to Cairo very handy. It's also just a 6-minute walk to Soho Square, there's a shuttle service to Soho Square every 15/ 20 minutes too until 11pm. We went there more than five times during our 8-day stay. A huge thank you to the entire team at Grand Oasis. They work collectively, very effectively, and efficiently, ensuring any hiccup is fixed right away.

That was exactly the reason why the four of us, two families, came here. In the hustle and bustle of life in Turkey, we all wanted to catch a breath, create beautiful memories, and relax. Our vacation at Jaz Belvedere was much more than just a pleasant stay. It became a place where we truly felt special and valued, not just a hotel.

The biggest reason for this was the hospitality and sincerity of the people working here. Everyone at the hotel kept our comfort and happiness as their priority at all times. Small inconveniences might happen, but thanks to their warm attention and efforts, nothing caught our eye.

One of the key people who made this experience so flawless is Amr Gamal. Although he is the highest-level manager at the hotel, he didn’t act like a manager, but like a true leader. Whenever there was an issue, he preferred to speak to us face to face, rather than via phone or message. He made us feel that we weren’t just guests of the hotel, but an important part of it. He was the one who ensured everything ran smoothly and took care of every detail in the background.

However, the person who made this journey so wonderful from the start was Atef Abdelzaher. From the very beginning, he took care of us personally, understood our needs, and guided us through everything. He is the person who made this flawless experience possible, as he was in constant communication with us from the beginning, directed our requests to the right people, and ensured that everything went smoothly. Even when we didn’t ask for it, he went above and beyond. The dedication and attention he showed are hard to describe in words. Atef definitely deserves much better opportunities.",1,"['atef definitely deserves', 'reason families came', 'hotel kept comfort', 'want vacation truly', 'key people experience']",[],['hotel'],[]

Apart from the water activities for kids there is not much to do. Steer clear of any external activity they try selling e.g ATV ride etc as the external vendor they are engaged with is not as good as a 5 star property should have ; I personally had a bad experience (activity was late by 50-60 mins ; ATV were old and worn out) along with a few other families who were part of the trip . Though the activity desk offered to do the trip again without charges but they need to realise that most guests have limited days stay and they have planned an itinerary for their stay thus cannot take out time again and again.

Property has too many rooms thus it seemed overcrowded to me all though well managed by staff but the number of people walking around all the time in the property was overwhelming.

Service is good but not proactive; you need to ask for it and they will fulfill...

The location is simply wonderful. The view from the room and from the outside space was incredible. 

It was nice to be on the quieter side of Elephantine Island and certainly away from Aswan centre itself. Its an easy 10min walk (although you may need them to show you the way the first time as its small alleyways) to the public ferry and it takes just a few minutes to cross over to central Aswan and the ferries runs constantly from 6am to midnight so you never have to wait long. There are no cars or paved roads on Elephantine Island so it feels a world away from Aswan itself. There are a number of small shops and cafes/restaurants on the east side of Elephantine Island about 15min walk from the guest house that serve food and drinks. We ate at Nile View Guest House several times and would recommend them highly for their food. The breakfasts were excellent too. 

The rooms are really clean, there is both a fan and AC and hot water. We were a family of 5 with 3 children and had booked two rooms. We were really comfortable and would highly recommend staying here when visiting Aswan.

We were collected on the pier side of Aswan when we arrived and taken across to Elephantine Island by the Nile View Guest House boat and they likewise took us back to the Aswan pier when we had to leave, even though this was at 3am!

Since there are no cars on the island, it is quiet and peaceful. The restaurants on the island are the best in Aswan and there are friendly dogs and cats everywhere.

Inicialmente, al llegar me atendieron dos hombres que no hablaban inglés, pero tampoco se interesaron en comunicarse. Evidentemente el apartamento era diferente. No tenía toallas, papel sanitario, jabones. La entrada tiene una vista tenebrosa, aunque no resultó en algo inseguro, al menos las dos noches que estuve allí. Al hacer la reclamación se mantuvieron en qué era el mismo apartamento, aunque no fue cierto. Ofrecen desayuno pero es totalmente falso porque en realidad nunca me indicaron dónde tomarlo y cuando lo pregunté, me responsabilizaron pero no dieron solución para tomarlo al siguiente día. Un amigo me acompañó para tomar las maletas en la mañana del último día y luego reclamaron queriendo cobrar más, cuando en realidad nunca prestaron atención a los comentarios que se hicieron. La verdad me siento muy decepcionada porque es un alojamiento costoso para el precio normal en Egipto y su servicio fue pésimo. Booking debería tener más cuidado con este tipo de estafas.

The apartment is not the same as the one shown in the pictures. Upon arrival, I was met by two men who didn’t speak English and showed no interest in communicating. Clearly, the apartment was different. It didn’t have towels, toilet paper, or soap. The entrance has a creepy view, though it didn’t feel unsafe, at least during the two nights I stayed there. When I filed a complaint, they insisted it was the same apartment, which was untrue. They advertise breakfast, but this is completely false since they never told me where to have it. When I asked, they blamed me but didn’t provide a solution for the next day.

A few examples - last year you could not even sit 2 minutes at a table until a waiter approached you - this has changed quite a bit and sometimes you have to even call up for a waiter to get table service. With regards to WiFi - this was a pure chaos - no self login was possible and you had to approach the reception with every device to unlock it - this is so off-standards for a hotel of that category. The tv (although not super important) did barely work although channels were displayed for German TV - most of them did not work or had no sound. In 2024 - there was a swarm of red-sea fishes in the lagoon, which was always a highlight for the kids - now, there are only a few fishes left which is sad to see. Moreover, and this was really a challenge for us - apparently the family rooms are only in one block (6000) and this is the closest to the main event area - on this one you have to get used to loud music up until 23:00 + there were construction works at the nearby hotel street + on next premises which started ~7.30 am with heavy tools which means heavy noise - it would not be a problem if the block 6000 was closed (which it is not, it is a partially open building without windows) or if the doors would be soundproof (which they are not at all) - therefore this really impacted our sleeping. We are now considering choosing a different hotel next time coming to Egypt - let's see.","The Dana Beach is still a great hotel if you just look at the facilities (e.g. pools, gym) , the food (we LOVE the Orient restaurant) or the animation (the dance crew was state of the art and incredible good). Our kids felt a bit like coming home from last year and as well very confident with all ways and facilities - which gives quite a relief for parents. Shopping opportunities are just across the street with good quality on clothes, food and spices. Beach is as well very nice and you get a lot of entertainment all day which is great to chose. Some of the staff like chefs or waiters provide really excellent service, are super attentive and fulfill you every wish - we are very grateful for this in general.",-1,"['orient restaurant', 'incredible good kids', 'staff like', 'spices beach', 'dana']","['regards wifi', 'coming egypt', 'hotel street', 'compare stay year', 'really impacted sleeping']","['beach', 'restaurant', 'staff']","['wifi', 'hotel']"

We arranged a private car transfer. The rep met us in the arrivals hall and pointed us towards the customs desk after which we had to go through bag x-ray, all fine. He said he would meet us in the foyer after this for our private car transfer. We went through, then waited for him...and waited...35 minutes later we were starting to worry where he was. He then appeared with a huge group of people whom he had been waiting for to go through customs, but they were a group transit via coach. He took us outside and pointed to our car with driver and we left. Surely it would have been better for the driver to have been standing in or just outside the foyer with a card with our name on it so once we're through we could leave immediately? There was no need for us to wait for the coach party as we were not on it! It kind of defeated the point of having a quick private transfer because it was not! We left the same time as the coach party! It would be simple to rectify, just have the car driver ready with a sign waiting for our exit. The return car transfer was fine, he was waiting in the hotel foyer to take us back, so quick and easy. Everything else was perfect.","Fantastic resort in a perfect location directly on Temple reef which was accessible from the shore or via a floating pontoon. Excellent snorkeling on a colourful and vibrant reef. One of the best I have experienced.
The resort is large, with very well kept beautiful grounds. There are several swimming pools and one heated one which was essential in November as the others were extremely cold! Our room was more like a suite, very large with a lovely modern walk in shower and a terrace with 2 chairs. Very comfortable. Our pillows were too large and hard, but we asked at reception to change them, and they were changed. There are several restaurants but some were closed due to low occupancy, but it made no difference as the food selection and quality in the buffet restaurants was excellent. You could choose from Italian pastas, roast meats, fish, prawns, crabs or oriental stir fries, noodles etc. plenty of salads, fruit and fabulous desserts. Really something for everyone. We ate at the Indian restaurant one night, and the kebab restaurant one night, (set menu) but honestly, the buffet restaurants were our favorite, so much choice! The biggest asset of this resort was the staff. Every single member of staff greeted us as they walked past. The serving staff in the restaurant remembered what drinks we liked and would bring them immediately on seeing us. The restaurant barman Mahmoud kept us supplied in red wine, and always with a big smile! The two pool guys would have our sun loungers ready for us and beer on the table as soon as we appeared. The attention to service was really excellent. The whole resort seemed to run very well and like clockwork especially in the restaurant. Incredibly organized. There were shows and animation for the children, but we didn't attend any as we were too tired from snorkeling and back in our room after dinner. The shows were noisy and our room was close by, but by 11pm it was finished and quiet, so never an issue.",-1,"['restaurants favorite choice', 'temple reef accessible', 'buffet restaurants', 'excellent snorkeling', 'resort large kept']","['think improved arrival', 'private car', 'people waiting customs', 'transfer went', 'arrival booked resort']",[],[]

As other reviews have said, it can be a bit tough to find but I'm sure a message or call when you arrive would make the process easy.

Recommend a beer on the rooftop - it's a little of a hike up but it's hard to find beer otherwise in the city and you might need one after walking around the sites all day.",1,"['recommend beer', 'hosts staff', 'stayed night', 'city need walking', 'luxor']",[],['staff'],[]

Unfortunately we didn't get to try anything specifically Nubian which would have made it more special. 

I loved that each unit had a laundry rack on the private patio (and definitely used it to hand wash!), but it would be even better to have a washing machine available for guests to use.","We wanted a very natural experience of Aswan, with calm nature and farmland surrounding us. This is exactly what we got at Maghribi - a perfect location with beautiful outdoor seating over the Nile; neighboring farmers next door and all along the Nile tending their lands along with their donkeys, cows and camels; tidy Nubian-style rooms. All green environment relaxing to the eyes with palms, mango trees, green fields. It felt very private and we were at home. 

The west bank was a perfect location and environment for the type of trip we were looking for. The surrounding village was very safe and welcoming to visitors exploring around, and not touristy at all. My boys got to know a very kind farmer next door who let them do a bit of work with him, which was a special experience. The ferry to cross over to Aswan city was only a 5-10 minute walk south (and ~5egp cost). There were a few small kiosks to buy drinks, snacks and basic medicines in that direction, but generally we needed to cross over to Aswan for dinner/restaurants. 

The kind family running Maghrabi facilitated our pick-up from the Aswan airport and drop-off to Luxor and suggested great Nile tour providers by motor boat and felucca (providing the contacts with which we made arrangements). They explained how we could ride horses/camels up the mountain a few minutes walk south. And they were always ready to serve fresh cool karkaday (hibiscus) juice in the evenings!

There wasn’t a single moment we were at the beach without someone from the spa or excursions approaching to sell services – and more than that, insisting on the sale.

The pricing and service quality left much to be desired. Nothing has a fixed price, and this made us feel like we were bargaining in Cairo instead of being at a well-structured resort. While we did book some services, the quality didn’t justify the premium pricing. Similarly, the excursion we booked for the safari was extremely disorganized and disappointing. On the way to the desert, we found out we were the couple who paid the most for the experience, with others being charged half the price. The transport was poor, the guide wasn’t friendly, and overall, the trip didn’t live up to what you’d expect from a resort. We’ve had much better experiences with external guides.","The resort's structure is absolutely incredible and exceeded all expectations regarding cleanliness and organization. The staff are extremely friendly and always have a smile on their faces, which made a huge difference. The chefs (especially Alaa Henedak) and the waiters at Alfredo were exceptionally attentive, remembering our names and even our favorite drinks – a special touch that made our stay unforgettable. Security officer Mohamed Ahmed was an absolute gem, taking care of us with so much care and kindness every step of the way, especially during our excursions. We felt 100% safe at all times.

A special highlight goes to Haitham, who made our experience truly one of a kind. He went above and beyond to make sure our first wedding anniversary was perfect, paying attention to every detail. He constantly checked in to see if we were okay and even sent messages to wish us a good day. His care and dedication were remarkable!

From the moment I arrived until the day of my departure, the hotel's exceptional host and staff went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and unforgettable.

First and foremost, the warm and welcoming nature of the host was evident from the very beginning. They greeted me with a genuine smile, making me feel instantly at ease. Their passion for hospitality and dedication to ensuring a delightful experience for their guests was truly commendable. They took the time to understand my needs and preferences, offering valuable insights and recommendations for exploring the beautiful Nubian Village and the surrounding areas.

The NUB INN Hotel itself is a true gem. Nestled in the heart of the Nubian Village, it offers a peaceful and serene atmosphere that perfectly complements the breathtaking natural beauty of the surroundings. The hotel's architecture and design reflect the rich cultural heritage of the Nubian people, with vibrant colours and traditional elements that add a unique touch to the overall ambience.

My room at the hotel was nothing short of exceptional. Impeccably clean, spacious, and tastefully decorated, it provided a comfortable sanctuary where I could relax and recharge after a day of exploration. The attention to detail was evident in every aspect, from the cosy bedding to the well-appointed amenities. 

What truly set the NUB INN Hotel apart, however, was the remarkable staff. After my experience in Cairo and Alexandria, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking an authentic and unforgettable stay in Aswan/Nubian Village. Whether you're a culture enthusiast, a nature lover, or simply seeking tranquillity, the NUB INN Hotel is the perfect choice for an extraordinary Nubian adventure.",1,"['recommend hotel seeking', 'stay aswan nubian', 'inn hotel perfect', 'nub inn', 'extraordinary nubian adventure']",[],['hotel'],[]

This situation escalated to my husband and son being threatened by the drunk individual and his friend, leaving us deeply disappointed and concerned. Despite being aware of his condition, the staff permitted him to enter, causing distress not only to our family but also to others. It’s alarming to think that some parents left their children at the club, unaware that a drunk adult behaving inappropriately was present.

The situation became even more serious when the drunk individual, along with his friend, threatened to physically harm my husband and son. This left my child traumatised, as he genuinely feared that his father would be attacked. The staff intervened far too late, and if they had taken action earlier, this altercation could have been entirely avoided.

What’s even more shocking is that the staff continued to allow this individual access to the club in the days following the incident, despite his inappropriate behavior. This created an unsafe and frightening environment for my son, who became anxious every time he saw them.

I strongly urge other parents not to leave their children unattended at the Rixy Kids Club. The staff failed to enforce proper safety precautions, allowing anyone—including those under the influence of alcohol—to enter. This negligence is unacceptable and poses a serious risk to the well-being and safety of the children in their care. Awful experience!

Although you are entitled to one à la carte dinner per stay, the reservations fill up quickly, often requiring you to book two days in advance. You have a choice between Italian and Asian cuisine, requiring you to communicate your preferences and number of guests ahead of time. Unfortunately, we were too late to make our reservation within our stay. It would be nice if the hotel would communicate this in advance.

For the great heated Olympic 50m pool, there is an extra charge of €5 per session, and wearing a swim cap is mandatory. The gym is excellent and open until 10 PM! However, it’s a pity that the 50m pool, which is solely for lap swimming, isn't open until 10 PM as well. There are two heated pools available (one with also a lenght of about 50m).

While the local lager beer is decent, the local wine (Obelisk) leaves much to be desired (see for comments/reviews on the Vivino appI). It s unfortunate that wines from neighboring countries (like Jordan and Lebanon, which produce excellent wines) aren't available for an additional cost, considering most guests are Russian and local tourists, who may not prioritize wine as much as we Europeans from the South do. Tip: buy a good bottle in the tax free shop of the airport of departure or skip alcohol during the stay of your holiday. 

Overall, the food is quite decent, with plenty of vegetables and fruits. However, the dining experience could be significantly improved with better wine options.

The swimming area and complete overall look and feel of resort is great; clean and nice staff.

The food was cool, we enjoyed the food, unfortunately the menu rotated between all restaurants, so there was not so much variety but finding good meals is possible. Just some fresh fruits at breakfast were missing. 
We were disappointed by the a la carte restaurant, even though the service was very accurate, the food wasn't special at all, I would say worse than in the other restaurants.
The pool with slides for children was nice but the slides are only for children above 100cm, for younger children they can only stay in the water not enjoying so much.

We always had water in bottle available in the room and it is available all over the structure.
Buildings are characteristic, and gardens are very well maintained.
The beach is big and it grants an easy access to water for children to play safely in the water. 
There is a limited zone to swim in deep waters, accessible by a pier, to see corals and fishes, it is not so big but there is so many things to see that it is more than enough. The corals and fishes are amazing. In December, the water temperature is good, 24-26°C,just protect yourself from the wind.
There is 1 restaurant a la carte réservation needed and other 5 free restaurants, we loved L'asiatique.
There are several swimming pools, 3 of them are heated.
From the structure there is a path that exists the resort along the sea, very beautiful walking also good to reach an amazing free beach.

Our stay at Malkata House was nothing short of magical. From the moment we arrived, we were enveloped in an atmosphere of warmth and genuine hospitality. The highlight of our experience was dining with the famous Chef Hassan, whose culinary creations were simply extraordinary. Each dish was a masterpiece, crafted with such skill and passion that it left us eagerly anticipating the next.

But what truly made our stay unforgettable was the connection we made with the staff, especially Ahmed. He wasn’t just a staff member, he spoke perfect English which helped connect with our children, he became part of our family. Ahmed went above and beyond to help our two kids, who grew so fond of him that they now adore him like a favorite uncle. We even had the pleasure of meeting Ahmed’s own family, which added a deeply personal touch to our visit. Spending time with them, and enjoying the company of some delightful animals, made our experience feel like a home away from home.

If you’re seeking more than just a place to stay—if you’re looking for an experience filled with amazing food, heartfelt connections, and unforgettable moments—Malkata House is the perfect destination. We can’t wait to return and meet Ahmed again!",-1,"['experience dining famous', 'ahmed family added', 'house stay', 'pleasure meeting ahmed', 'malkata']",[],[],[]

The morning started with a rich buffet and with omelettes made on the spot by Yousef a very polite and good boy, at the restaurant we met many good waiters like Moamen Aleuar, a special thanks goes to Abdel Rahman a young waiter with a strong enthusiasm for the job and the relationship with people. However all the staff is extraordinary and smiling.

  The dinner buffet was often repetitive but overall good. With the all inclusive formula obviously they use local spirits, but in my opinion very poor in plastic bottles ... the Gin & tonic for example was horrible .. the same wine.

 Culina which should be an a la carte restaurant that can be used once a week to give space to everyone I found myself not very welcoming, waiters not very attentive to the customer, I found myself eating dessert with dirty plates still on the table.

I must also commend Mohamed from Room Service, whose dedication and professionalism were evident in every detail of his work. It is rare to come across someone so committed to ensuring guests feel completely at ease.

The entire team of services, maintenance, and housekeeping deserves recognition for their impeccable work. The cleanliness and upkeep of the resort were nothing short of extraordinary, reflecting the highest standards of hospitality.

The resort’s chefs offerings left us in awe. With 7 or 8 restaurants to choose from, the variety and quality of food catered to every taste and preference, making each meal a delightful experience.

The heated pools—7 out of 10—were immaculately maintained, with lifeguards ensuring safety at all times. This feature allowed us to relax knowing our children were safe while enjoying the pools.

The resort’s design and aesthetic, from the harmonious paint colors to the stunning landscapes and breathtaking views from every room, created an ambiance of tranquility and elegance. The combination of nature and thoughtful design made the resort a visual masterpiece.

Everything else was fantastic.","This hotel is now one of our favourites. It was such a unique place to stay. If you are hesitating, don't! It was a great choice.

The decor, in traditional Nubian style, is colourful and amazing in every last detail. The location allows for an outstanding view over the Nile river - we couldn't stop looking at it and we stayed in the infinity pool for a long time just watching the boats. The pool is refreshing after a hot day. There are also comfortable lounge chairs around the pool area that also have a view (as well as from your balcony). The drive to the hotel is up a long bumpy road by car or tuk tuk and you will feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, but this allows for a very quiet stay and the beautiful view! We were worried about not being in Aswan but, in our opinion, this was better. 

The shower pressure was great and the air conditioning works very well. The bed is very comfortable with great pillows and linens. 

The staff is kind and they arranged all our excursions and drivers and that all worked very well - on time and organized and we thought it was reasonably priced. It is perhaps best and easiest to organize airport pick up and excursions with them as the hotel is quite isolated.

We ate dinner at the restaurant every night and the food was the best we had in Egypt - the Nubian tagine was great. There is a large variety of food to choose from. The breakfast was eggs done any way you would like, baloney and cheese slices and yogurt and pita. It is served fresh (not a buffet) which we liked, just leave a bit of time for it to be served. There was plenty of food to fuel up for the day. 

We watched the locals and tourists swimming in the Nile for a long time and wanted to try it and the staff showed us a staircase down the hill behind the hotel for us to walk down. It looks steep and long, but is reasonably easy - ask the to show you - it was so fun!",-1,"['bed comfortable great', 'airport pick excursions', 'unique place stay', 'tourists swimming nile', 'best egypt']","['area', 'worked fantastic', 'pool', 'restaurant', 'wifi']",['nile'],"['wifi', 'pool', 'restaurant']"

The price of the food was 2 times the average. I would lower the prices.","We loved the Jewel Howard Carter hotel.
It was super clean, with new room forniture, sheets and buildings. Also, they changed the table clothes of the restaurant everyday.

The food was good, but you need to like the Egyptian food. Two Belgian tourists did not like the ""sandwich"" bread because they expected the classic french baguette but actually they serve the the naan/pita bread. We like it so it did not bother us.

The concierges were very nice, they upgraded our room for free because I contacted them the day before asking for a Nile view room.
They did not have any problem with us booking directly a private boat or a car without passing through them. I really liked this professional way of working. This is how local economy flourishes. The biggest issue in Egypt is finding reasonable prices for services because EVERYBODY tries to do the middle men gaining money on behalf of poor drivers which receives practically nothing for their precious services. 
Also, they never asked for tips, that's why we left them the change when we payed the restaurant bill.
To be even more professional I would suggest to put in the room a price list of car and boat tours with the direct contact of the drivers so the guests would not feel exploited.

The location was amazing! Very fresh and quiet! The best place for bird watching if you walk south and reach the closest boath pier (50meters).

First off, the actual accommodation is wonderful, really pretty and very clean. The hotel features a restaurant which serves homemade meals which are prepared on the spot and taste great. We opted to have dinner at the hotel all the nights we spent here because we simply wouldn’t bother to look elsewhere after dining here once - and we usually like to explore more options.
In terms of service the hotel helped us organize our trips and excursions around the area, which was very convenient for us and, surprisingly was settled at prices very similar to the ones we found online (by unknown to us organizers) - sometimes even better!
Lastly and most importantly, the attentiveness and kindness of the staff has been truly unbelievable. Every single person from the staff helped and answered every question we had and they were always happy to do so. 
We have travelled in many places around the world, yet the Nubian people have really been spectacularly amazing, both in terms of their hospitality and their kindness. Never have we ever felt so sincerely welcomed by accommodation staff. Each and every one have been unique in their own way and each and everyone stole a piece of our hearts. 

We will be back!

It exceeded my expectations. The rooms were very spacious, clean and comfortable, with a fridge and kettle. The shower had hot water and the wi-fi connection was the best I had in one month in Egypt. The views were also great, and the rooftop was amazing, with great food. Basmatic has the tallest rooftop in that area, and the view is particularly beautiful as it is facing the Aga Khan Mausoleum and the sand dunes of the West Bank of the Nile. It is a perfect spot for sunrise and sunset, as the light on the dunes and the Nile is particularly beautiful at that time. 

In my opinion, it is the best location in Aswan: while Aswan is a big city with tall, ugly buildings and lots of noise, Elephantine Island is incredibly quiet and laid back. Unlike the Nubian Village which is a tourist trap full of touts and souvenir shops, Elephantine Island is still authentic and you can experience simple village life here (there are no souvenir shops or touts to bother you). The view is much more beautiful on the West side of the island, because the West side faces the sand dunes, while the East sides faces the buildings of Aswan. 

The hotel staff members were all very helpful and helped me arrange my trip. The taxi driver and boat driver they recommended were also great, so I had a great time during my stay! Although I had found cheaper options nearby, Basmatic was well worth the price difference, because the rooms and views were a lot better.

They had a few really cute and friendly dogs and puppies as well, but were also always ready to move them away for someone in our group who was scared of dogs.

I sent two messages to the hotel to confirm the flight time and they said someone would be waiting for us with a sign. After landing, we waited for the transfer for 1:30h after having to borrow a phone and call the hotel.

Feels like staff treatment change over time. The tipping culture is very strong in there. 

The hotel recommendation for day trips is the diving center in the beach. That is totally not reliable. Not to be trusted. Scams and overpriced, low quality services. What you buy is not what you get. We bought a private tour to orange bay with dolphins chasing, our choice of how long we stay in the island and a specific boat. We got no dolphin chasing, a strict 1h in the island and a random boat not what we paid for. In a different occasion, where we had already handed 10 euros to the guy, he returned 10 egyptian pounds which we only saw after getting the hotel. I talked to him next day, I said he made a confusion with the money, he acknowledged and we never saw the money back even meeting them everyday in the beach in the following days. Use GetYourGuide and your chances of being satisfied will raise exponentially.

They have red flags you can borrow to hang in your sun beds so salesmen won’t come to you. Does not work.

The hotel management should take a closer look at that and not allow guests to be harassed like that.","Beautiful hotel, well maintained. The room was just fine. Had a comfortable space.

1- Although the guest assistance specialist was helpful, she either didn't know or told me a lie that my upgrade was to a junior suite. Yes, I got an upgrade, but to Deluxe room not a junior suite. She should have known better. 
2- Room 3202 is near the staff entrance, so every morning when their shift starts before 7 am, you would wake up to shouting and screaming of the maintenance staff. This is the First time to notice that during my stays at Citadel. I thought it is just one separate incident, unfortunately, this is the norm.
3- Air vent in the bathroom was not working, so I asked the reception to send someone. The next day, I got a message from the guest assistance Radwa, if everything was OK, so I asked her to help with the same issue. The next morning nothing is fixed, and another lady called asking if everything was OK. I told her about the air vent. Just then the maintenance team came to fix it. Still it was too noisy during the rest of my stay.
4- The light of the shaving mirror was not working.
5- For the first time , internet wifi service and coverage was below my expectations. On my fourth day of stay, I had to use my cellphone internet as there was no wifi service at all. 
6- To my surprise, someone decided to fix a bed or a chair in the corridor. That took him nearly two hours banging and stapling fabric and wood, to the extent that I called the reception asking for a solution for the situation. That was not so wise to fix a piece of furniture in a corridor of rooms full of guests. That added up to the daily situation of screaming and shouting of the staff at the start of their shifts before 7 am. The receptionist promised he would check it and call me back, which he never did.
7- The staff at Bodda are cold. I believe they could be more welcoming, definitely should be more friendly.","The moment you set a foot in the hotel you feel welcomed by everyone. This is not my first time in Citadel, I believe it is the tenth or eleventh. 
I liked the Christmas dinner and party, they were lively and fun. The entertainment team did a great job. The flyover part was so nice.
The variety of food and the vibes of the restaurants are excellent. Although each restaurant has its own specialty, still they all share the welcoming , friendly and helpful staff. In Citadel, there are Walid, Ezeddin,Ali, Hosam, Abdulla and all the helpers are magnificent. 
In Culina, Ramadan, Abdallah, Ahmad, Mahmood are always available to help with a friendly welcoming smile. 
In Marina restaurant, the pizza chef is above and beyond. 
The lady host at Rocks lounge is so passionate about her guests. 
I was lucky to see Mostafa at the reception, he is really above and beyond.

Nubian hospitality was generous and above anything we had experienced so far.

From the moment you book they are here for you and will go above and beyond to make sure your stay is as smooth and pleasant as possible.
Answering my never ending list of question, thank you for your patience.

Helping us to organise our short stay, tours etc..
Taha and his brother Ossam were the most genuine people we have met in our entire trip and made our stay very special.

Their guesthouse is well looked after and such a beautiful place you wish you never had to leave.

You can order food with them in advance and their sister Fatima will cook for you, I highly recommend it.
Breakfast was plenty and diverse to help you start the day.

Our room was spotless, cozy and nice decorations.

They will help you reach the east bank on their shuttle boat anytime you need.

It is one of this little gem you wish you would keep to yourself but the history of this family makes it even more special and you should stay here while in Aswan, it's peaceful and you re out of the hussle and bustle.

Seem old and way way to soft. I asked for new mattresses and staff changed the mattresses immediately and gave us 'new' ones that were just as bad. The hotel is simply way to expensive to have such awful beds. It could actually make me not want to book again.

It would be nice if you could just take beer, water, icecream and coke yourself at the pool/beach. It's annoying that you have to wait in line to get water. It would be easier for the guests and also for you, if you let them do it themselves.","Food is excellent (and we're pretty picky...) There's something for everyone. House reef is the best in Sinai so if you like snorkeling you should choose either Sentido or Jaz next door. There's actually still colourful corals. I really liked the platform in the sea with a life guard who could tell people not to stand on the corrals. That seems to work to some extent.

Staff is very friendly and service-minded, but also really interested in tips, which is annoying. Maybe you should pay them a bit more. Internet is not the best, but it's there - which is pretty good for Egypt...

Rooms:

Daily cleaning was thorough, and the room attendant was exceptionally attentive, even creating towel animals for the child.

Food:

All-inclusive food was abundant throughout the day at various locations.

Main meal buffets were good but could use a bit more variety and flavor. Desserts were always mediocre. Shortage of table cutlery is an issue.

Other Services:

Some sales personnel from the beauty salon, spa, and dive center were a bit too repetitive on sales at pools and beach areas, although their service quality was excellent, but pricey.

Resort had helpful ATM's and convenient stores.

Concierge was excellent, and the hotel-organized 3rd party trip to the Ras Mohammed reserve was fantastic for diving and snorkelling.

Advance! It was given to us.
On the night of 19 to 20 on my birthday I again made a request to leave two hours later even if it was charged. It was ceded me without any price. The next day 11:30 told me to leave the pool after they said yes the night before!
In addition, I asked the manager for help to get me a driver's contact to take me to some places. The agreed was 1300 Egyptian pounds for 20kms price far above average in what is practiced on site. But everything is fine. However, at the time of charging there were already 1500 Egyptian pounds exactly at least 20kms. What is wrong! On the night of the 19th birthday as I mentioned so many times at the hotel for all employees the manager sent me several attached messages and made me out of the room as I was lying to pay the hotel and the transfer since I told me earlier that I could pay when I wanted and at the time I wanted to pay on time and he didn't want to! What is completely inadmissible to remove a customer on the birthday of the bed!
When I arrived at the reception the first thing I said was that this was not done on the day of a person much less than a client is a lack of respect. Where he told me that the next day there would be no ATM machine and that the driver was out there waiting! Lie I went out and wasn't! The car was from the manager he asked a street boy to do so. My sunglasses were in the car and they didn't give me back what is theft! I refused to pay for another 200 Egyptian pounds because it had not been what we agreed. In addition to all this, at night they knocked on the bedroom door at 3:30 in the morning and again at 5:30 in the morning! My mate was extremely worried about fear that they opened the door or something happened since we are two women in an Arab country! And my second time in Egypt!","The pool!

I was worried that we might be a bit isolated and find it harder to get places, but it was so easy to catch boats (the public ferry is there every 5-10 minutes) and the island was just absolutely idyllic. Thanks to Mohammed we were able to see Philae Temple and he recommended we watch the sunset from a mountain above the nobles tombs. We spent the whole day with the lovely Mahmoud who took us out on the boat, taking us from the glorious botanical gardens to the Nubian villages where we bought fresh spices.
Don’t miss out on some amazing restaurants nearby - we went to King Jamaica Cafe several times, they did lovely food and really good Shisha, plus were very friendly staff. Makanni restaurant just next to the port is also good for tourists, and we had an amazing meal at Mezze Restaurant in Movenpick.

The rooms are modern, tidy, and well-equipped, though they are a bit small. One other thing to note is that the sea view rooms actually overlook the pool rather than the sea itself, which was a bit unexpected for a Deluxe Sea View price.

One of the highlights was the grill on the terrace—it was fantastic! The staff were wonderful, especially Nour, who was super helpful and spoke fluent English. The resort is quite far from Hurghada's main area, making it a peaceful and secluded getaway—perfect if you're looking to relax, but keep in mind that it's a bit of a trip if you want to explore the city.

Overall, a great choice for those looking for an all inclusive beautiful and relaxing beach resort experience!",1,"['getaway perfect', 'resort quite far', 'gorgeous pools', 'beachfront', 'sea view rooms']",[],"['sea', 'view']",[]

Initially, when I arrived, two men who did not speak English, but were not interested in communicating. Obviously the apartment was different. I had no towels, sanitary paper, soaps. The entrance has a dark view, although it did not result in something insecure, at least the two nights I was there. When making the claim they remained what the same apartment was, although it was not true. They offer breakfast but it's totally false because they never really told me where to take it and when I asked, they held me responsible but did not give a solution to take it the next day. A friend accompanied me to take the bags on the morning of the last day and then claimed wanting to charge more, when they never paid attention to the comments made. I really feel very disappointed because it is expensive accommodation for the normal price in Egypt and its service was lousy. Booking should be more careful with this type of scams.

WHEN I FILED A COMPALINT, they insisted it was The Same Apartment, Which Was Untrue. They Advertise Breakfast, But This is Completely False Since The Never Told Me Where to have it. WHEN I ASKED, They Blamed Me But Didn’t provides solution for the Next Day.

* About uber drivers (nothing to do with Bellagio): we landed around midnight and after the visa process when we ordered an uber (for ~200EGP which is ~4EUR) the drivers accepted the ride but they started to negotiate in messages that they take us only for 15-20EUR. After canceling a few ride, eventually we made a deal with one of them to take us for 7 EUR (but the reason, they were telling, that they have to pay extra fee to enter the airport is true, though it's just 30 EGP ~ 0,5 EUR)","We have been in Hurghada for just 3 nights from 8th Feb till 11th Feb 2025, but for this short amount of time this hotel was perfect for us with my partner:

* We booked our room pretty last minute (2 days before arrival), but Omar, the operation manager has contacted me directly through WhatsApp on the day of our arrival. They have not replied my questions on booking.com, but after asking them again through the app, he ensured me he will handle all my requests (e.g. they served us dinner in the room after checking in) - he even checked on me the day after, if there is anything else I would still need
* We got a room upgrade for free (from deluxe to superior), and when we had some difficulties with the noisy fridge, they helped us change the room for an even better one.
* Our flight was scheduled after midnight, so we have not booked our room for this last night, but they let us stay in the hotel till dinner (including all meals) for free and gave us a late-late-late check-out possibility as well
* Talking about foods: the variety was more than enough for all the main courses, and the 24h open ""sweet bar"" offered everything we could have wanted as snacks (fruits, sandwiches, cookies, etc.). There was also a nice buffet next to the pool where we could have pizza slices and burgers during the whole day.
* Drink were ok for us: it is true, that they are not using the big brands, but otherwise, in general it was perfect a nice time. And they are making ice from bottled water, so it also wasn't an issue!
* Animation team was doing a great job during the day and during the night shows as well
* Though the location is a bit out of the city, but for us it was even better, because this way it was quiet enough during the evening; and wherever we had to go, we could get there for 4-5 EURs

During the day you can hear construction site noise, which is extremely annoying if you want to relax on the pool. The bathrooms and rooms were still full of construction. There is no alcohol in the entire hotel and in the restaurant and smoking is not welcome. There is currently only one restaurant outside the hotel complex. You first have to order a cart for the lobby (the goods are always late) and from there a bus drives to the restaurant. This means that if you want to eat, you are always dependent on 2 trip services. We took 30 minutes for breakfast until all the shuttles were there. We met other guests who thought that there was a free shuttle to the airport. We were only offered the variant for € 40, which is a pure rip -off. There is also not much in Neu-Assuan.
