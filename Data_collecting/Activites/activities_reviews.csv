Sharm El Sheikh,Anonymous,NULL,The overall experience was ok. However the food was not according to expectation and turned lights off while we were eating. BBQ dinner was not enough .A miscommunication at start as we were asked to pay more for quad bike. Toilet was blocked no water for hand wash for men. Poorly organised venue.

What I did not understand we bought two tickets, both tickets had the same price but we did not get two atv‚Äôs but one double. This is not mentioned anywhere and it was our first disappointment, second, they tell you show will take 2.5hour but it means you wait 2 hours until it starts.

Sharm El Sheikh,Anonymous,NULL,"It is recommended trip to Sharm visitors. However, I will mention some of the points that I don‚Äôt like. 1. Picked up at 7:45 am and waiting till 11:00 in the marina. 2. Unhappy staff 3. Lunch was good but I don‚Äôt know why the serving was per minimum. 4. Even though the drinks was included but no offer it. 5. The boat stopped working on the way back which delayed us from getting off. 6. The return driver was impolite and not professional. He asked me to get off 2Km away from my hotel and he made a miss when I asked him to drop us from the original pick up point. My recommendation is to ask about the boat name and read the customers reviews since you can from a hundred boats at the marina.","Posted August 12, 2024 on Booking.com",Visited with family

Sharm El Sheikh,Maja,Serbia,"It is amazing experience, worth the price, very nice and informative tour guide. What i didnt like is around 3h pick up time, not organised so well though i understand some people are not respecting others and being late, but 3h was too much. Also we were promised a small breakfast at the end of the hike but i didnt get anything and thats why i give 4 stars. We had to listen english and russian information, even though russians did understand english and weren't interested, i would understand if it was arabic and english, or if it was half of the group speaking any language. Other than that, this didn't seemed fair. Tour itself, hiking and monestery- perfect.

The weather is very hot and it‚Äôs not nice nor wise to keep postponing the period of waiting for the guests. If you are allergic to the smell of petrol/gas then best to stay off the first floor as you can smell the gas from the motor room.

Drove a short while, did a boat trip to cross the Nile with coffee/tea and cookies, another short drive and arrived to watch the balloons being fired up. Hopped into the balloon and floated over the Valley of the King's and saw the sunrise over the Nile. The groundcrew worked really hard running through the fields to ensure a soft landing. Back to the hotel. Still can't believe it was real, feels like a dream!!","Posted January 20, 2024 on Viator",NULL

Luxor,ThiLanHuong_T,NULL,"We thoroughly enjoyed the trip. Our tour guide, Hassan, is quite a good vivid story teller. He explained the history of egypt and its past kingdom very thorougly that even I, a non-history person, can follow easily. His English is really good and he even can speak French to me. Momen, our driver also made sure that the trip was safe and pleasant. We basically covered everything in Luxor in a day like they stated so by the end of the trip, we were quite tired with the jet lag. We did go back to Luxor temple the next day to enjoy it more for our own preference. Overall, I was happy to book this tour.","Posted March 01, 2024 on Viator",NULL
Luxor,Sheree_S,NULL,Absolutely incredible experience. Noby was so well informed and knowledgeable. Traveling by myself I always try get a solo guide and a driver. It‚Äôs totally worth it as you hear and see so much more than in a large group. Noby cherry picks the best out of the five areas you go to. A full 6 hours with an amazing lunch. He will go as fast or slow as you need..there is a lot to take in but at the end you totally understand the connections of this amazing civilization. Such a pleasure to be with and a brilliant experience. What an amazing guide and driver. Memories that will last forever. Noby also takes the best pics.. better than a selfie stick üòÇüòé‚ú®üôèüèº thank you ‚Ä¶,"Posted February 26, 2024 on Viator",NULL

Luxor,Rakan,NULL,"One of the most amazing trips I ever had in Egypt. For the people who have a short stay, this is the right trip, as you see most of the important locations. I would recommend to add to it the Vally of The Queens as well as an extra.

I was guided by Barry, who made me feel that I'm with a friend rather than a guide. Very cooperative and will focus on what matters to you.","Posted February 13, 2024 on Viator",NULL

Luxor,Anonymous,NULL,"Stunning experience doing the balloon ride over Luxor. We didnt know if we were going to be able to go up and so we waited for a while and we were worried the flight would be cancelled. Luckily we got good news and we had an amazing flight over Luxor. It made me feel good that safety was prioritized. One thing I will say is that the light ""breakfast"" or ""refreshments"" that were advertised didn't happen, but all in all it was a great morning. They also ask you to do some impromptu poses and hand holding so they can sell you the video of the flight after, but it didn't feel pressured so that was fine. The guide and pilot were great!","Posted October 24, 2024 on Booking.com",Visited solo
Luxor,Naeem,United Kingdom,"Overall the experience was good, they offered tea and coffee however no snack. The flying experience was good nice height. We were also able to purchase the photo and video recording of the experience for $30 however the quality is not that great.

Luxor,Anonymous,NULL,"The organiser didn't tell me the pick-up time so I was assuming they would come to my hotel at 5am or later but they actually came at 4:10 and called me saying like 'where are you? our guy is waiting for you'. I was just awoken by the call so had to prepare very quickly, and got no apologies from the organiser on this. The balloon ride itself was amazing and I loved it but they can improve as to customer services.","Posted March 31, 2024 on Booking.com",Visited solo
