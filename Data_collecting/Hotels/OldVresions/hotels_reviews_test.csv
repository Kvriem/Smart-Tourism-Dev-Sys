We both had such a wonderful stay at Serenity Lodge, the room was spacious and clean, the pools and outdoor surroundings were beautiful, all staff were super friendly, a nice selection of food/ drinks from the bar (MANGO juice was our fave) and it really was the most perfect spot for sunrise and sunset!

Thank you so much for a wonderful stay! We‚Äôll definitely be back and I‚Äôll pop by to say ‚Äòhello‚Äô when I‚Äôm back to working in Sharm in March!

Thanks again,

The overall place could do with a freshen up."
"Serenity Lodge (Bed and Breakfast), Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt) Deals",Serenity Lodge,Stefano,Italy,14 nights ¬∑ ,January 2025,Solo traveler,Double Room,"Reviewed: January 26, 2025","The name alone would be enough to comment on the entire structure.
This is the right place to spend a holiday in total serenity, calm and peace in the company of a good book to read.
Here you will not have anyone asking you if you want to have a massage, a tour in the desert, a boat trip. You will not have anyone asking you to go and play water games in the pool and you will not hear disco music at full volume, all typical things of a village-resort.
Here you will have light background music that will accompany your breakfast by the pool, your lunch or your dinner.
No blinding lights but soft lighting in all the common areas and in the morning you can enjoy one of the most colorful sunrises I have ever seen.
The pool is perfectly maintained and in the 15 days of my stay we were never more than 3 people.
The lodge offers an excellent economic taxi service .
All the photos from the lodge published correspond to reality.
However, all this has a price.
1) The menu available is 90% Egyptian in which you will surely find what suits you;
2) Only 2 people speak English: Awari and Hamad to whom you should address all your requests. ""ASK AND YOU WILL BE GIVEN"". Change of sheets, cleaning of the room, other towels. Just ask.
3) Google translator in Arabic will be very helpful.
4) The cooking times are a bit long but just order in advance.
In addition, the property hosts people of various nationalities, for free, in exchange for work in the lodge.
All credit cards are accepted as well cash then you do not need to get local Pound.
I will return for a week next February",No Negative Feedback

The food is delicious, although waiting time is no less than an hour, even if they tell you 20 minutes. The location is great for snorkeling, many of the boats come here for snorkeling trips. Otherwise the place is a bit far from everything else, which is why it is so peaceful. Ashraf who runs the taxi services is punctual and nicely priced.","Lots of things as mentioned by other reviewers. Despite all the faults I would still book this place again. Communication in English is a real problem, but the new Italian girl is making a positive difference. Some of the other staff seem to be in a bit of a daze."

"Serenity Lodge (Bed and Breakfast), Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt) Deals",Serenity Lodge,Denise,Germany,13 nights ¬∑ ,August 2024,Group,Double Room,"Reviewed: August 29, 2024","This place is pure magicüí´. If you are looking for a place to relax, to snorkel in a peaceful and colorful environment or to come together with likeminded people or to talk about the universe, then you are the right place! The personnel is beyond friendly and very eager to help you in any situation possible. The owner is also very, very friendly and helpful. 

They have their own taxi drivers and even though Serenity Lodge is a bit further away from those busy areas, it's absolutely worth it. The prices are also very fair.

PS: They just built a very cool and cosy area next to the pool where you can work as a digital nomad! They even have charging stations on the pillars of the whole construction - it¬¥s just amazing!","Id o not have any negative points, just two things I¬¥d probably do in the near future.

I¬¥d only put some seating furniture on the balcony, a table and two chairs for those who need to work in the room and some plants in the rooms to make it more cosy, but I think its already in the making. 

And I¬¥d add the Egyptian Salads (Mezze) that you get in any restaurant to the menu. They are so delicious and it is really great if you don't need to go out for that (but this is just a very personal thing cause I could eat this from dust till dawn) üòÅ"

"Serenity Lodge (Bed and Breakfast), Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt) Deals",Serenity Lodge,Frederik,Belgium,7 nights ¬∑ ,August 2024,Couple,Double Room,"Reviewed: August 28, 2024","- Superb staff
- Great kitchen with lots of variation
- Relaxing location
- Music all day long, always fitting the moment at the perfect loudness

As they mention themselves: ""A beach resort for those who don't like beach resorts""","- Wifi is pretty volatile (which inadvertently pushes you towards a real vacation/disconnection mood)
- 1 out of 2 mattresses in our room was pretty dated/worn out
- Some small issues with inconsistent water supply in our room"
"Serenity Lodge (Bed and Breakfast), Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt) Deals",Serenity Lodge,Cesare,Italy,1 night ¬∑ ,August 2024,Solo traveler,Double Room,"Reviewed: August 8, 2024","It's a very quiet small resort, right onto the sea, and the snorkelling just in front is nice. The pool's a bit shallow but clean and big enough to take a short swim, definitely a big plus ! The staff is also friendly and helpful, I was given a free upgrade to my room which was big and had great seaview ! The breakfast is included, not much choice but it's decent and quite abundant. Overall you get pretty good value for your money.","When you book it they send you an automated email with informations about the property, stating you can reach the closest shopping mall (Soho Square) walking your way 15 mins through a shortcut. This is actually not true. You can't walk on the coast because it's blocked by other properties. If you try shortcutting inland you have to pass through White Hills resort, their security guys will stop you and ask you questions. They will eventually let you pass but it's unpleasant and you will take 25 minutes. Taking the public road along the airport will take you 1 hour. 
In other words you will have to take a taxi to go anywhere from this place, which is easy to do but not exactly cheap if you need to do it all the time. 
The kitchen opens at 13.30 for lunch, which is unreasonably late (standard lunch time is 12-15 everywhere in the world). They have no beer. 
There's no proper beach, to access the sea easily you have to wait for high tide or wear sea shoes (which are offered for free) because when the water is shallow you walk on sharp rocks and corals. 
Overall I would still strongly recommend this place because it's just beautiful but bear in mind there are reasons why it's this cheap compared to other resorts in Sharms on similarly beautiful spots."

"Serenity Lodge (Bed and Breakfast), Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt) Deals",Serenity Lodge,Dayon,Croatia,2 nights ¬∑ ,January 2024,Couple,Quadruple Room,"Reviewed: April 5, 2024","The staff were very friendly and the atmosphere between the guests and the staff was excellent. The prices were reasonable and the location a few steps from the very blue Red Sea is a big plus. Our room was large and the beds comfortable. The selection of snacks and dishes they provide might not have been the most extensive, but quite tasty. The pool and the light reflecting off the water really creates a pleasant visual effect during the day and the fact that the property is at the end of the road and facing the sea really makes you feel the tranquility of its setting.","The location is also a double-edged sword. Getting to the property requires passing a succession of very dusty construction sites, some of which are abandoned too, so you have to be mindful of deep, unsecured open pits. I know this is not something the owner of the property can control, but it does contribute -negatively- to the overall guest experience. You really want to have your phone flashlight on when coming back at night from the lights of Soho Square as you'd be passing through a poorly lit area. The most impactful negative aspect of staying here, in our books, was the mosquitos - the first night when we didn't have any repellent, I must have killed between 40 and 50 in our room. If 1993 gave us ""Sleepless in Seattle"", that night in January 2024 we were certainly ""Sleepless in Sharm el Sheikh"" and ""exhausted in Egypt""..."

Especially Suleiman was very helpful in everything. What I liked most about this place is the chill and a private atmosphere due to its location -which is a bit far from touristic places- and size. The view from our room was amazing. The area that the Lodge is situated in, is a new developing area with many construction sites. However, the sound of construction was not so troubling and because there are not many tourists or people around the area, the coral reeves in the sea remains wild and intact. Once we got through the rocks in the sea and put goggles on, what we saw astonished us. Fish in every color, oysters that are purple and blue inside, even a white sting ray i saw‚Ä¶ it was a fantastic experience. Though for travelers who are looking for more of a hotel experience, dont want to walk to the supermarket, looking for luxury and a sandy docile beach, this might not be the right place. 
Breakfast and food in the Lodge was also great and safe to eat. 
I felt safe as a female traveler here and would recommend this place to solo female travelers.",It would be good if there is a well-equipped first aid kit in the hotel.

We were a little sceptical at 1st as the lodge is'nt close to town, but nothing a quick taxi ride could'nt fix. There is no need to book a snorkeling trip on get your guide as the lodge offers snorkeling equipment for rent for as little as 1USD for the day. After that you can walk down to the beach (where by the way, most of the get your guide companies bring their clients for an hour or so) and immerse yourself into another world. We saw a wide variety of fish as well as manta rays and were close to what I call the drop-off which opens up a whole other world! The owner also recommended a small stable for horse riding in the Nabq Nature Reserve which was definitely worth it. In all, it was a great stay with friendly staff who were helpful in every way, even when we struck bad luck with our flights they tried to assist as much as possible.

The staff are not just friendly‚Äîthey are true professionals. They go above and beyond to ensure everything you need or want is taken care of seamlessly. Now that I‚Äôm staying in another hotel of the same class and with similar Booking.com scores, I can confidently say that Virginia Hotel stood out in every way, especially for families with children.

My child had an amazing time thanks to the entertainment and animation team. Their dedication and energy were outstanding, making every moment fun and engaging. As vegetarians, food is very important for us, and Virginia Hotel exceeded all our expectations. The vegetarian options were absolutely perfect‚Äîbetter even than the food at another hotel we stayed in, which had a 9.8 food rating on Booking.com. The meals at Virginia felt more thoughtful, fresh, and catered to our preferences.

I also want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire staff for their warm hospitality and genuine care. Staying at Virginia Hotel felt like being with family, and now that I‚Äôm in a different hotel, I genuinely miss the sense of connection and warmth I felt there.

If you‚Äôre traveling with children, I highly recommend Virginia Hotel. It‚Äôs a place where both adults and kids can feel completely at home, cared for, and entertained. Thank you, Virginia Hotel team, for an unforgettable stay!","The rest of the hotel has a lot of potential, but updating the bathrooms would significantly enhance the guest comfort."

The hotel communication beforehand was fantastic. 
when we checked in the staff were brilliant, best of all we were given a WIFI data box that we could use both in the hotel and out and about. Our teenagers were so happy and the wifi was perfect throughout the stay even when we took trips out (we had no data in egypt).
We were given 2 huge interconnecting rooms, 
The food was great even though my youngest is very fussy!
Breakfast, fresh omlette station and fresh pancakes. Bread rolls, warm food (beans / porridge / boiled eggs / cooked hot dogs), cheese and cold meat station, finally a 'cake' station with doughnuts, croissants and pastries (they were a little dry, but still nice)
Lunch, fresh pasta station and french fries. bread and salad bar. Rice (delicious!) with hot food like vegetable stew (i loved this) and various meat stews. almost always some sort of roast chicken or fish. Cake station with strangely coloured cakes which were odd looking (for British people), but were pretty delicious!
Dinner - very similar to lunch just different hot stews and there was often a bbq meat section. 
Basically there was always something for everyone. 
the drinks were the least varied, just squash/coke/sprite/fanta/tonic plus spirits. we did get a little bored of the same drinks. 
The service at the hotel was exceptional, the best I have ever experienced. Thank you Mahmoud Samv, Mohamed Shaban, Hossam and Ahmed (house keeping). Those are the names I have but Everyone deserves a mention. Smiles and amazing service.
You get a bus to the beach, the coral beach was the best ($3 extra each), The main pool with the slides was cold as it was december, but there is a heated smaller pool. I'd love to return in the warmer months.","The only downside were the drinks. There was only one coffee machine, no hot chocolate and the coffee was instant. My husband loves his coffee so it would have been nice to have a nicer selection, even fruit teas would have been nice. My children did get a little bored of the selection of soft drinks as well, fresh juice would have been nice. But I am only saying this as a small downside."

It‚Äôs a good size: doesn‚Äôt feel like a mass tourist conveyor, the hotel spaces feel quite cosy. The food is a good level for Egypt, I wish they presented their cuisine a bit more though rather than give Europeans what they are used to.","Internet is painfully slow - good if you want digital detox.

Everyone in this place was so nice and helpful, trying so hard to make you happy and feel comfortable and well-served. Excellent service in the reception, restaurant and rooms. The food was delicious with a good variety everyday. The hotel was clean and well maintained. There are two main pools; the bigger one has a nice small aqua park, but is cold now in December, the smaller one is heated and suitable for relaxation. The safe guard at the pool Mr. Ayman was always there to take care of everyone especially kids. He was very nice and friendly. There is a rocky coral beach, for a small fee but they generously gave us a free pass as it was our honeymoon and they gave us a nice fruit plate in our room, in the coral beach you can see different types of fish and corals with the naked eye. There is a good space for snorkeling to see more. There is another free of charge sandy beach. It was good, cozy and good for kids. Both of the beaches had good water temperature so you can enjoy it that time of the year. You can reach the beaches by a shuttle bus which was always on time. We liked the animation shows. The hotel location is great, allowed us to explore the area.
Special thanks to Mr. Mohamed Shabaan, the restaurant manager, who was very keen on looking after his residence and making sure everything is working to perfection. And many thanks to all the restaurant staff. The entire team is really good. Special thanks to chef. Yahia, he makes really tasty chicken and meat. We talked to him about a recipe and loved how he looked passionate and professional. Many thanks to the receptionists Mr. Islam and Mr. Mohamed, they were very nice and helpful. We loved how the whole hotel staff looked like a big family, working together to make everything perfect for guests.","The room furniture wasn't the best but it was clean and ok for us. The floor in the room was not swipped and mobbed regularly but they did it before asking.
The sandy beach is not deep enough for full enjoyment."
