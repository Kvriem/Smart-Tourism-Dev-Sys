A good experience overall.","The Wi-Fi is VERY slow and keeps asking you to introduce the user, we did ask if they have a better one since it does say in the booking they offer a high speed one but we had no luck, also mention that they have a shuttle to the airport and is not the reality either as what they offer is to go outside to negotiate with a taxi driver a price that suits you."

The staff was warm, welcoming, and incredibly attentive. They made sure I had everything I needed, and their hospitality truly stood out. Whether it was helping with local recommendations or arranging for activities, they went above and beyond to ensure my stay was seamless and enjoyable.

My room was spacious, comfortable, and beautifully designed with modern amenities, all while maintaining a sense of elegance and tranquility. 

The resort itself offered a variety of amazing facilities, including a lovely pool area, excellent dining options, and well-maintained grounds. I particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which had a great variety of fresh and delicious options to start the day.

Overall, my time at Resort Nile River View was an unforgettable experience. If you're looking for a peaceful, luxurious, and culturally rich getaway, I highly recommend this resort. I can’t wait to come back!",My stay was short! I wish i could have stayed longer.

Each room has its little garden with two chairs and a table, you can take lengthy walks between the beautiful and unique trees or along the nile at the edge of the island, the plants are unique and exquisite. Three large pools, endless sunbeds and seating options throughout the huge gardens, activities for every age and every person whether a zoo for the children or kids play areas, spa with massages, aerobics and pilates classes, chess and fishing activities - so much to do at the hotel. The location is amazing as you’re in the middle of the nile away from the noise but at the same time it is very well connected to the city either via taxis that are lined up outside the hotel or 2 shuttle busses for free.","The food quality is not good. I stayed at this hotel several times before with my mother (booking was always under her name), and the thing we enjoyed the most was the food, it was delicious.
This time the experience was very disappointing. The variety itself is big and good, but the tase and quality are bad. The bread is very stale, three breakfasts and it was always stale as if it was bread from the previous days. At Dinner, the variety was not the best but it was okay-ish. The taste was again not good, the food is bland, a lot of seasoning is missing. We were very disappointed because Felucca Restaurant was one of our highlights, we loved the breakfast and dinner there everytime we stayed. This time it was not good at all. The Italian restaurant was good however."

The staff absolutely refused for us to bring the outside food into the premises. We had a group of 15 people with several rooms booked for three nights and they would not make an exception. We had seven hangry children and had no choice but to sit on the sidewalk outside of the entryway and stuff down our dinner. My husband ended up throwing his dinner away as the check-in process took so long. Needless to say, this was a terrible, frustrating first impression."

I always started my day with a happy stomach here. The sunset and night views were perfect, and there were small live local band performances. Absolutely worth staying!","The only inconvenience I found was the room key. Sometimes it wouldn't work, and I had to reactivate it at the lobby. After asking about it, the staff informed us that the key shouldn't be placed near a cellphone or credit card. It would have been great if they had told us this during check-in, so we didn't have to walk all the way to reactivate it, especially since our room was quite far from the lobby. The WiFi worked perfectly fine in the lobby but not in the room. The air conditioner was old-school style—it worked great, but it didn’t have a heating option, so the nights were pretty chilly."

The staff were amazing, in particular Rehman, upon check in we ended up upgrading our room for one with a better view of the Nile and did not regret this as the view is spectacular, especially during sunset. The room is clean and comfortable, the only issue we had was the TV doesn't screen mirror using apple devices, you must have an android phone. The outdoor area and pools are great, in particular we really liked the infinity pool, its quieter and has a great sunset view. Plenty of space to sit around the pool and the hammocks are so comfortable I had a nap. The staff around the pool are really attentive with offering plenty of towels. The food is great at the restaurant and pricing is decent. The spa is amazing, we got a room overlooking the Nile and massages were great, the other spa facilities and sauna are also really nice.

I enjoyed outdoors a lot, there is a nice pool and an infinity pool at SPA area. Staff was very kind, helpful and attentive - I ordered caramel frappucino but I got watery and not so nice coffee. A man came up to me later saying he’s a bar manager and asked how I find food and beverage so I was honest and said I’m disappointed with this iced coffee, he apologized and said he will make one for me himself the way it should be which is with whipped cream and actual caramel. It was great and I highly appreciated that. Not only that but there were many amazing other people that made this stay great for me. There were disappointments for this price though and I will list it below.","The rooms are seriously past their usage date and by that I mean for a 5 star hotel and such price they shouldn’t look so used, dirty and similar to rooms I used to rent in Thailand for 20$ a night. They were clean but very used, dirty walls, doors, mirrors, corners, rust and shower head literally fell apart in my hands while I was showering, I regret not taking a picture of it. I put it together somehow and it worked but it shouldn’t have happened and that’s a big shame. Food I would say was also just ok, breakfast as well just ok, in terms of taste and freshness. Another point is SPA. Insanely overpriced and extremely mediocre, I was hugely disappointed with my massage (she checked her phone while massaging, probably for the time but I found it unprofessional and never happened to me in other hotels) and massage itself was not so great, not anything special it was just ok, my boyfriend could do the same but for almost 200$ it shouldn’t be that way. I was expecting something amazing as well for seeing all those awards all over the place. I will leave my honest review here since I didn’t say that to the staff when asked how was my treatment, my boyfriend was next to me and he gifted me this massage so i said it was good because I didn’t want him to feel bad for doing something nice for me. I do not recommend."

Sayed will be your contact person for the entire cruise and he is truly exceptional. From greeting you in person on the day, to personalising your tour options, Sayed takes genuine care of you and is contactable with any questions at any time. 

When you book this cruise you will be on a boat with other people that have booked the same cruise through various tour agencies at double the price! A couple we became friends with had paid AUS $3,800 through Viator for the same cruise (ours was AUS $1,600 through booking.com, saving us AUS $2,200 less than everyone else!) 

Just a few examples of Sayed’s customer service include providing us a SIM card for internet access the entire cruise (which other couples did not have) providing us washing powder free of charge, and also providing us 6 large bottles of water on arrival. 

This is certainly a more budget friendly cruise option, however if you are looking for something more luxurious I would recommend sending Sayed a direct message and he will be able to provide you with the options of all the boat direct to you (this cuts out the middle man such as tour agencies) and made our cruise cost of other guests! 

The tours arranged by Sayed (including all drivers and guides) were great. The highlight was our tour guide at Luxor! 

Thank you very much again to Sayed for organising the trip!","A few things to note about the boat Royal Ruby - all inclusive does not include any drinks or water. When speaking with a group of people at our dinner table 2 rooms did not have working toilets, and all 4 rooms did not have any hot water on the final day. The rooms are quite small, the beds like most places are two singles pushed together which isn’t the most comfy, and the boat also has strange odours on several floors, however the service is great. The buffet each day was extensive, and take away breakfasts are packed for days you need to leave early for tours. We highly recommend you add the hot air balloon experience in Luxor, it was amazing!"

Thanks to Mr. Sayed, through whom we coordinated everything, for his great and ongoing communication, attention to detail and going above & beyond to ensure we had a wonderful trip. 
First time in Egypt and this Nile cruise hit all the major spots from Aswan to Luxor with excellent, informative Egyptologist tour guides, comfortable accommodations, excellent food and the best staff! 

Our cruise was aboard the Nile Capital (after conferring with Mr. Sayed to determine which cruise ship best fit our needs), and we had the best (quiet) rooms with excellent views from our large windows. The staff aboard the ship were wonderful and accommodating! They truly made sure we enjoyed every second we were on the ship. Food was very good with a variety of options and changing lunch/dinner menus. Kids greatly enjoyed the pool and we enjoyed drinks while coasting along the Nile. 

The tour guides arrived promptly for each tour, were very informative and helpful, and also accommodating to our youngish kids who were hot and tired and at times had trouble concentrating!

Lastly - Mr. Sayed was absolutely wonderful- if there was anything we wanted or needed we knew we could reach out to him! The wonderful sunset felucca ride was the icing on the cake. We cannot wait to return to Egypt (so much more to see than we could accomplish in the one trip) and will definitely be reaching out to Mr. Sayed directly to help arrange all our needs!

The buffet included in the package was overall delicious with variety of options to choose from every day. I was very sceptical whether this booking is going to be like a scam, but everything turned out well. 

Some info for the future guests reading my review: I booked 3 nights starting from Aswan to Luxor. The tour package is not included in the fare and costs $250 + $35 tips per person with a guide that speaks German and English recommended by the cruise. The guide took us to all the must see sights and explained the basic stuffs. Quite a lot of upselling during the tour to convince us to buy additional tours but not too pushy. Overall, I would say it is still worth having a guide as he kept us away from all the hassles on the street. Meal on the ship starts at around 6.30/13.00/19.30 and drinks are not included in the package. But drinks are priced fairly. Tips were collected centrally at the end of the trip and guest can place the tips (recommended $5 per person per night) in a mailbox which will then be distributed to the entire staffs.","Overall the ship and facility needs renovation. No slippers included in the room as the carpet is dirty and outdated. The information is not widely available online about the ships schedule, tour package, and it's docking station. Better communication about those things will gain more trust from the tourists. Depends on where your room locates, sound insulation could be an issue. Bring some earplugs with you to sleep better. Also, if your are vegan, this cruise is not for you."

We did the 7-day tour and as we only booked on booking.com we didn't have a dedicated tour guide that accompanied us (like other guests that booked with a tour operator), but that way we had our own private guide(s) in our language when visiting sights which was extremely nice and comfortable! Also the cruise management at the reception made sure we knew when and what was on our daily plan. 
We had a nice room, enough space and the daily housekeeping did a fantastic job! We liked that you can open the big windows in your room to sit and enjoy the green river banks passing by. The bathroom was clean and big enough (remember your still on a boat). 
As previous comments said, yes, it can happen that another boat is next to you but for us it was only shortly. 
The food is open buffet with great quality and selection of different dietary options (dietary options not really marked but you can always ask the staff). For instance we're both vegetarian and we had more than enough options for every meal. Abdul was our waiter and so very kind!!
I'd like to highlight that every staff member on the boat was super nice and helpful! 
I think you can do the 4-day itinerary too but then your days are packed. Depends on our time but for us 7-days were fine and we would choose same again.","- sundeck could be improved to be more cozy (like add some decoration/plants or so)
- carpet floors in the room could need a high performance vacuum cleaning treatment 
- be aware that you stay in Luxor and Aswan for consecutive days and so don't change location every day 
- be aware it's not an ecological way of transport as generators have to run 24/7"

They want you to pay $250 extra to take a guide for the 3 days but I did it without, just taking local taxis and using local guides - way cheaper and keeps the money in the towns.","Hmmm.... the price quoted on Booking.com was NOT the price I ended up paying - I ended up paying almost a £100 more but there wasn't much I could do about that.

A kettle in the room would be good.

I live in Egypt and quite savvy to the street hustles but got scammed by a worker from the boat who saw me on the street and said 'hi'. I only wanted directions to a pharmacy but of course i got 'guided' to his local spice shop and scammed into paying way over the odds for teas i didn't want/ need and then he asked for more baksheesh (tips) on top. Not ok. Not professional. Left a bit of a bad taste."

"M/S Nephtis Nile Cruise (Cruise), Luxor (Egypt) deals",M/S Nephtis Nile Cruise,Marianne,Denmark,4 nights · ,October 2024,Solo traveller,Triple Room with Private Bathroom,Reviewed: 21 October 2024,"IT's a SCAM. The GTS Cairo Group own or lease rooms on several cruise ships sailing on the Nile. We had booked a 3-persons room with balcony on M/S Nephtis Nile Cruise (specifice because of the balcony and 3-person room 28m2 which not many Nile cruises offer).
We were picked up in Luxsor Airport by a staff member of GTS. He was in a hurry getting us out of the airport and keept mention the name Royal Ruby. We told him that we had booked cruise on Nephtis. He looked very confused and called the his office. He informed us that Nephtis wasn't sailing and we had been ""upgraded"" to 5* ship Royal Ruby WITHOUT our KNOWLEDGE or ACCEPT.
Arriving on the ship his focuse was getting paid CASH the amount we had accepted booking our room at Nephtis BEFORE we were showed our new room.
Once the payment was made we were taken to our room. It was ONE 2-pers room 21m2 with no balcony (only a sliding window) and an extra bed squeezed in. We immidiatly got hold of the GTS man and complained about the room size, the missing balcony. He called the GTS office and I got a lady (Rasha) on the phone who couldn't/wouldn't understand/see the issue. We had been ""upgraded"" to a 5* ship and were therefore was NOT entiteled to compentation or reimbursment of the price difference (usd 714,-) between the Nephtis and Royal Ruby.
During our 4 night/5 day stay we tried several time to get in contact with someone on the ship (no one had any authorit) and when we finaly got in contact with GTS Office they insisted that we was NOT entiteled to compensation or reimbursment as 3 persons CAN NOT book/stay in a 2-pers room and we therefor would be charged for 2X 2-pers rooms though we ONLY had ONE 2-person room where we stayed the full cruise.","Looking a reviews for Nephtis Nile Cruise at Booking.com there only a few saying almost nothing. On other sites we have found that we're not the only ones who had been ""upgraded"" to other 5* ships (Rammes 2 - Samirames 1 etc) 
I starting to doubt that M/S Nephtis exist at all.
The service and food on board Royal Ruby was awfull. Very few of the cruise staff speak english, the entertainment at night was non existing and the Food was the same every day/night."

The crew was amazing and no request went unfulfilled. Everything was done with a smile and sincere warmth. Meals were served buffet style and were wonderful. So many choices! Also included was a carving station, fresh pasta station and an egg/omelette/crepe station. Drinks during lunch and dinner were not included, but very reasonably priced. We opted to purchase the optional tour package at $250 a piece. Great decision, as there were only two other clients and we were provided admission, transportation and a professional guide during our visits to all the historic sites. It was well worth it!","The Crown Prince was relocated to dockage 10km from the center of Luxor the week prior to our arrival and was difficult to locate. Our driver had to ask directions to find it. Overall the Crown Prince is a good ship, however it is tired and needs major work. The tile in our bathroom was missing grout, sealant was missing in the shower and the water temperature in the shower continuously changed while showering. There are few electrical outlets in the room and I was forced to disconnect a light to set up a charging station for our cell phones. At one point, the ship also developed engine trouble and we ended up not stopping at Kom Ombo, as we arrived there after the site had closed. This was disappointing! I realized that all of the Nile cruise ships were being run 24/7, with no down time. This again attests to phenomenal work by the crew to make the cruise run as smoothly as it did. Overall, it was still a good experience."

We did not book the excursion package as this was very expensive in comparison with the actual cost. We made all our excursions on our own and managed fine at less than 3rd of the price/person.
The international atmosphere on board was very nice and allthough the itinerary was with 'Egyptian' times, we enjoyed the actual cruising very much. It is very relaxing to sit on deck (trying to stay out of direct sun) and read a book about the old Egyptian civilization and seeing the landscape go back that is described in the same book.... Just wonderful.","Sundeck should also have section with chaise longs in a constant shadow so that people don't have to move and look for that one place without direct sun!! 
What I definately not like is the fact that I requested a 'quiet' room and I get the room right under the dance floor?!! 
Most of the time we are docked between other boats which means we hardly ever can leave our curtains open en enjoy the view. Being in our room means ALWAYS sitting in artificial light. 
Also pictures on booking.com definately not match the reality. 'What's wrong with the picture' is definately a question we can ask ourselves. 
Location in Luxor is very misleading. Far away from the center and the front of the Luxor Temple!!"

From the moment I arrived, I was greeted by the most welcoming host, who made me feel like a valued guest right from the start. Their warm hospitality set the tone for the entire stay.

The staff at this hotel is truly exceptional. Every member of the team goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is nothing short of perfect. Whether it was the front desk staff offering great tips on local attractions or the housekeeping team ensuring my room was always pristine, their attention to detail and genuine care made all the difference. They were always available when needed and took the time to make sure I was comfortable, no matter the request.

The hotel itself is spotless and very well-maintained. The rooms are spacious, modern, and equipped with everything you could possibly need. I especially appreciated the convenience of its location – it’s just a short distance from major attractions like Habu Temple, Valley of the kings and Queens, making it the perfect base for exploring the city.

And let’s talk about breakfast – it was absolutely delicious! Every morning, I was treated to a wide variety of fresh, flavorful options. From traditional Egyptian dishes to international favorites, the spread was always well-prepared, and I could tell that everything was made with care. It was the perfect way to start my day before heading out to explore Luxor.

Despite its location in a quiet village, the apartment exceeded expectations with its modern appliances, spacious layout, and stunning balcony views with such an affordable price. It was perfect for our group of 5 girls, offering both privacy and a strong sense of security. The location is also ideal for hot air balloon rides and temple visits.

We were lucky to stay when the host's family was present, and their hospitality was one of the highlights of our trip. Communication in English was very smooth, and they were always ready to help with our itinerary, offering valuable advice, like tips on taking a felucca on the Nile.

Their warm hospitality made our stay truly unique and enriching, as they even took the time to show us around the village, adding a special touch to our experience.

We also faced a minor issue with our driver before heading to the airport, but the host’s family stepped in to resolve it quickly, making us feel supported the whole time.

Dar Lina Guesthouse Luxor (Guest house) (Egypt) deals,Dar Lina Guesthouse Luxor,Pablo,Argentina,6 nights · ,January 2025,Family,Apartment - Ground Floor,Reviewed: 28 January 2025,"Our stay at Dar Lina Guesthouse was absolutely fantastic. The facilities were great and the flat is fully equipped with anything you could need. We had the flat on the ground floor and it came with a beautiful garden, two rooms, a living room with TV, two bathrooms and kitchen. One of the things we enjoyed the most was the fact that there is a washing machine, which is a great asset when walking around in dusty and hot Luxor. I think this flat is perfect for a family or even a group of friends, and even though there are nice hotels on the other side of the Nile, we really appreciated being in a neighbourhood that felt authentic, for instance, only a few minutes away from the flat there is a banana field that is absolutely beautiful. Finally, the flat is 5min away from a main street with little shops to buy food, etc and a 10min walk will take you to the ferry that crosses the Nile. The flat is also perfectly located if you plan on visiting the Valley of Kings, as it's only 15/20min by car.","I would recommend arriving to the flat during the day if possible, as it can be a bit hard to find for taxi drivers and if it's your first time in Egypt the surroundings can feel a bit scary. The more the days passed by we actually realised it was a beautiful and super calm neighbourhood though."

My room was spacious, comfortable, and beautifully designed with modern amenities, all while maintaining a sense of elegance and tranquility.

Three large pools, endless sunbeds and seating options throughout the huge gardens, activities for every age and every person whether a zoo for the children or kids play areas, spa with massages, aerobics and pilates classes, chess and fishing activities - so much to do at the hotel. The location is amazing as you’re in the middle of the nile away from the noise but at the same time it is very well connected to the city either via taxis that are lined up outside the hotel or 2 shuttle busses for free.","The food quality is not good. I stayed at this hotel several times before with my mother (booking was always under her name), and the thing we enjoyed the most was the food, it was delicious.
This time the experience was very disappointing. The variety itself is big and good, but the tase and quality are bad. The bread is very stale, three breakfasts and it was always stale as if it was bread from the previous days. At Dinner, the variety was not the best but it was okay-ish. The taste was again not good, the food is bland, a lot of seasoning is missing. We were very disappointed because Felucca Restaurant was one of our highlights, we loved the breakfast and dinner there everytime we stayed. This time it was not good at all. The Italian restaurant was good however."

I always started my day with a happy stomach here. The sunset and night views were perfect, and there were small live local band performances. Absolutely worth staying!","The only inconvenience I found was the room key. Sometimes it wouldn't work, and I had to reactivate it at the lobby. After asking about it, the staff informed us that the key shouldn't be placed near a cellphone or credit card. It would have been great if they had told us this during check-in, so we didn't have to walk all the way to reactivate it, especially since our room was quite far from the lobby. The WiFi worked perfectly fine in the lobby but not in the room. The air conditioner was old-school style—it worked great, but it didn’t have a heating option, so the nights were pretty chilly."

Whilst the 5 day formula may be ideal for those arriving and departing from the airport directly, bear in mind that the ship doesn't actually sail until day 2 and is already at its destination on the 3rd night - so, if you spend time visiting sites on your own before/after the cruise, some of the time on board may seem redundant.

The staff were amazing, in particular Rehman, upon check in we ended up upgrading our room for one with a better view of the Nile and did not regret this as the view is spectacular, especially during sunset. The room is clean and comfortable, the only issue we had was the TV doesn't screen mirror using apple devices, you must have an android phone. The outdoor area and pools are great, in particular we really liked the infinity pool, its quieter and has a great sunset view. Plenty of space to sit around the pool and the hammocks are so comfortable I had a nap. The staff around the pool are really attentive with offering plenty of towels. The food is great at the restaurant and pricing is decent. The spa is amazing, we got a room overlooking the Nile and massages were great, the other spa facilities and sauna are also really nice.

I enjoyed outdoors a lot, there is a nice pool and an infinity pool at SPA area. Staff was very kind, helpful and attentive - I ordered caramel frappucino but I got watery and not so nice coffee. A man came up to me later saying he’s a bar manager and asked how I find food and beverage so I was honest and said I’m disappointed with this iced coffee, he apologized and said he will make one for me himself the way it should be which is with whipped cream and actual caramel. It was great and I highly appreciated that. Not only that but there were many amazing other people that made this stay great for me. There were disappointments for this price though and I will list it below.","The rooms are seriously past their usage date and by that I mean for a 5 star hotel and such price they shouldn’t look so used, dirty and similar to rooms I used to rent in Thailand for 20$ a night. They were clean but very used, dirty walls, doors, mirrors, corners, rust and shower head literally fell apart in my hands while I was showering, I regret not taking a picture of it. I put it together somehow and it worked but it shouldn’t have happened and that’s a big shame. Food I would say was also just ok, breakfast as well just ok, in terms of taste and freshness. Another point is SPA. Insanely overpriced and extremely mediocre, I was hugely disappointed with my massage (she checked her phone while massaging, probably for the time but I found it unprofessional and never happened to me in other hotels) and massage itself was not so great, not anything special it was just ok, my boyfriend could do the same but for almost 200$ it shouldn’t be that way. I was expecting something amazing as well for seeing all those awards all over the place. I will leave my honest review here since I didn’t say that to the staff when asked how was my treatment, my boyfriend was next to me and he gifted me this massage so i said it was good because I didn’t want him to feel bad for doing something nice for me. I do not recommend."

The roof terrace had amazing views. There were laundry facilities. I felt safe & if I needed anything, Mohammed or Ahmed were quick to help out. Restaurants near by offered a great choice of local or International cuisine. The public ferry was close by - it cost 15 Egyptian Pounds one way.

Sayed will be your contact person for the entire cruise and he is truly exceptional. From greeting you in person on the day, to personalising your tour options, Sayed takes genuine care of you and is contactable with any questions at any time. 

When you book this cruise you will be on a boat with other people that have booked the same cruise through various tour agencies at double the price! A couple we became friends with had paid AUS $3,800 through Viator for the same cruise (ours was AUS $1,600 through booking.com, saving us AUS $2,200 less than everyone else!) 

Just a few examples of Sayed’s customer service include providing us a SIM card for internet access the entire cruise (which other couples did not have) providing us washing powder free of charge, and also providing us 6 large bottles of water on arrival. 

This is certainly a more budget friendly cruise option, however if you are looking for something more luxurious I would recommend sending Sayed a direct message and he will be able to provide you with the options of all the boat direct to you (this cuts out the middle man such as tour agencies) and made our cruise cost of other guests! 

The tours arranged by Sayed (including all drivers and guides) were great. The highlight was our tour guide at Luxor! 

Thank you very much again to Sayed for organising the trip!","A few things to note about the boat Royal Ruby - all inclusive does not include any drinks or water. When speaking with a group of people at our dinner table 2 rooms did not have working toilets, and all 4 rooms did not have any hot water on the final day. The rooms are quite small, the beds like most places are two singles pushed together which isn’t the most comfy, and the boat also has strange odours on several floors, however the service is great. The buffet each day was extensive, and take away breakfasts are packed for days you need to leave early for tours. We highly recommend you add the hot air balloon experience in Luxor, it was amazing!"

First time in Egypt and this Nile cruise hit all the major spots from Aswan to Luxor with excellent, informative Egyptologist tour guides, comfortable accommodations, excellent food and the best staff! 

Our cruise was aboard the Nile Capital (after conferring with Mr. Sayed to determine which cruise ship best fit our needs), and we had the best (quiet) rooms with excellent views from our large windows. The staff aboard the ship were wonderful and accommodating! They truly made sure we enjoyed every second we were on the ship. Food was very good with a variety of options and changing lunch/dinner menus. Kids greatly enjoyed the pool and we enjoyed drinks while coasting along the Nile. 

The tour guides arrived promptly for each tour, were very informative and helpful, and also accommodating to our youngish kids who were hot and tired and at times had trouble concentrating!

Lastly - Mr. Sayed was absolutely wonderful- if there was anything we wanted or needed we knew we could reach out to him! The wonderful sunset felucca ride was the icing on the cake. We cannot wait to return to Egypt (so much more to see than we could accomplish in the one trip) and will definitely be reaching out to Mr. Sayed directly to help arrange all our needs!

The buffet included in the package was overall delicious with variety of options to choose from every day. I was very sceptical whether this booking is going to be like a scam, but everything turned out well. 

Some info for the future guests reading my review: I booked 3 nights starting from Aswan to Luxor. The tour package is not included in the fare and costs $250 + $35 tips per person with a guide that speaks German and English recommended by the cruise. The guide took us to all the must see sights and explained the basic stuffs. Quite a lot of upselling during the tour to convince us to buy additional tours but not too pushy. Overall, I would say it is still worth having a guide as he kept us away from all the hassles on the street. Meal on the ship starts at around 6.30/13.00/19.30 and drinks are not included in the package. But drinks are priced fairly. Tips were collected centrally at the end of the trip and guest can place the tips (recommended $5 per person per night) in a mailbox which will then be distributed to the entire staffs.","Overall the ship and facility needs renovation. No slippers included in the room as the carpet is dirty and outdated. The information is not widely available online about the ships schedule, tour package, and it's docking station. Better communication about those things will gain more trust from the tourists. Depends on where your room locates, sound insulation could be an issue. Bring some earplugs with you to sleep better. Also, if your are vegan, this cruise is not for you."

We did the 7-day tour and as we only booked on booking.com we didn't have a dedicated tour guide that accompanied us (like other guests that booked with a tour operator), but that way we had our own private guide(s) in our language when visiting sights which was extremely nice and comfortable! Also the cruise management at the reception made sure we knew when and what was on our daily plan. 
We had a nice room, enough space and the daily housekeeping did a fantastic job! We liked that you can open the big windows in your room to sit and enjoy the green river banks passing by. The bathroom was clean and big enough (remember your still on a boat). 
As previous comments said, yes, it can happen that another boat is next to you but for us it was only shortly. 
The food is open buffet with great quality and selection of different dietary options (dietary options not really marked but you can always ask the staff). For instance we're both vegetarian and we had more than enough options for every meal. Abdul was our waiter and so very kind!!
I'd like to highlight that every staff member on the boat was super nice and helpful! 
I think you can do the 4-day itinerary too but then your days are packed. Depends on our time but for us 7-days were fine and we would choose same again.","- sundeck could be improved to be more cozy (like add some decoration/plants or so)
- carpet floors in the room could need a high performance vacuum cleaning treatment 
- be aware that you stay in Luxor and Aswan for consecutive days and so don't change location every day 
- be aware it's not an ecological way of transport as generators have to run 24/7"

Our stay at the Sofitel Winter Palace in Luxor was nothing short of extraordinary. This hotel, a converted 19th-century winter palace, exudes a timeless elegance that transports you to a bygone era. While the term “palace” may evoke images of castles or fairy-tale grandeur, the Winter Palace is instead a magnificent example of refined luxury—a stately, grand residence steeped in history and charm.

Location and Grounds
Nestled on the banks of the Nile, the property boasts expansive grounds featuring some of the most exquisite gardens we’ve ever seen. These meticulously maintained gardens are a true highlight, creating an oasis of tranquility in the heart of Luxor. Whether strolling among the lush greenery or relaxing by the inviting pool, we found the outdoor spaces to be a perfect complement to the hotel’s regal interiors.

Timeless Elegance
The Sofitel Winter Palace retains much of its late 19th- and early 20th-century character, making it a visual delight. The hotel’s interiors are filled with elegant touches: opulent chandeliers, richly crafted furniture, and intimate, atmospheric spaces. The bar, with its dark wood and leather furnishings, evokes the era of the British Empire, offering a warm and nostalgic ambiance. The vast salon area—a grand room reminiscent of a scene from Downton Abbey—is a place where you want to linger, read, or simply soak in the history. Nearly every corner of the hotel invites you to stop and take a photo, capturing its timeless beauty.

Accommodations and Dining
Our room, overlooking the Nile, was equally charming, blending classic design with modern comforts. The sunsets over the river were magical, and we spent our evenings on the front veranda, enjoying drinks and watching the day fade away.

The hotel features a highly regarded French-style restaurant with a formal dress code, which we regrettably did not have the opportunity to try.",No Negative Feedback

The minibar does not work like any other hotel we have ever been to - they do NOT stock it or apparently take note of what you have used! We certainly did not realise this until paying the final bill and making the assumption items used had been added. Unfortunately the receptionist was not too kindly when the error was discovered. It would be great if the hotel made this more obvious than it was - unfortunate end to a fab stay.

Naturally the guests should observe the local protocols with plenty of tipping.,"The food was good but not great. We went in the summer (off-peak) so perhaps they did not have enough customers to justify a wider variety of food. But it was still ok.

The tours were average for the high price. We took many tours (from Viator) beforehand in Cairo and felt that we paid much less for similar tours."

I'm vegan but don't shout about it and just accommodate but when the restaurant found out they went out of their way to provide the most delicious food I can eat.

The room was way more luxurious than I expected and the bed super comfy.

Housekeeping was great and room super clean.

Don't ask for the Nile view, choose the shore side, you'll see more.

None of the trips are included. They want you to pay $250 extra to take a guide for the 3 days but I did it without, just taking local taxis and using local guides - way cheaper and keeps the money in the towns.","Hmmm.... the price quoted on Booking.com was NOT the price I ended up paying - I ended up paying almost a £100 more but there wasn't much I could do about that.

A kettle in the room would be good.

I live in Egypt and quite savvy to the street hustles but got scammed by a worker from the boat who saw me on the street and said 'hi'. I only wanted directions to a pharmacy but of course i got 'guided' to his local spice shop and scammed into paying way over the odds for teas i didn't want/ need and then he asked for more baksheesh (tips) on top. Not ok. Not professional. Left a bit of a bad taste."

"M/S Nephtis Nile Cruise (Cruise), Luxor (Egypt) deals",M/S Nephtis Nile Cruise,Marianne,Denmark,4 nights · ,October 2024,Solo traveller,Triple Room with Private Bathroom,Reviewed: 21 October 2024,"IT's a SCAM. The GTS Cairo Group own or lease rooms on several cruise ships sailing on the Nile. We had booked a 3-persons room with balcony on M/S Nephtis Nile Cruise (specifice because of the balcony and 3-person room 28m2 which not many Nile cruises offer).
We were picked up in Luxsor Airport by a staff member of GTS. He was in a hurry getting us out of the airport and keept mention the name Royal Ruby. We told him that we had booked cruise on Nephtis. He looked very confused and called the his office. He informed us that Nephtis wasn't sailing and we had been ""upgraded"" to 5* ship Royal Ruby WITHOUT our KNOWLEDGE or ACCEPT.
Arriving on the ship his focuse was getting paid CASH the amount we had accepted booking our room at Nephtis BEFORE we were showed our new room.
Once the payment was made we were taken to our room. It was ONE 2-pers room 21m2 with no balcony (only a sliding window) and an extra bed squeezed in. We immidiatly got hold of the GTS man and complained about the room size, the missing balcony. He called the GTS office and I got a lady (Rasha) on the phone who couldn't/wouldn't understand/see the issue. We had been ""upgraded"" to a 5* ship and were therefore was NOT entiteled to compentation or reimbursment of the price difference (usd 714,-) between the Nephtis and Royal Ruby.
During our 4 night/5 day stay we tried several time to get in contact with someone on the ship (no one had any authorit) and when we finaly got in contact with GTS Office they insisted that we was NOT entiteled to compensation or reimbursment as 3 persons CAN NOT book/stay in a 2-pers room and we therefor would be charged for 2X 2-pers rooms though we ONLY had ONE 2-person room where we stayed the full cruise.","Looking a reviews for Nephtis Nile Cruise at Booking.com there only a few saying almost nothing. On other sites we have found that we're not the only ones who had been ""upgraded"" to other 5* ships (Rammes 2 - Samirames 1 etc) 
I starting to doubt that M/S Nephtis exist at all.
The service and food on board Royal Ruby was awfull. Very few of the cruise staff speak english, the entertainment at night was non existing and the Food was the same every day/night."

The crew was amazing and no request went unfulfilled. Everything was done with a smile and sincere warmth. Meals were served buffet style and were wonderful. So many choices! Also included was a carving station, fresh pasta station and an egg/omelette/crepe station. Drinks during lunch and dinner were not included, but very reasonably priced. We opted to purchase the optional tour package at $250 a piece. Great decision, as there were only two other clients and we were provided admission, transportation and a professional guide during our visits to all the historic sites. It was well worth it!","The Crown Prince was relocated to dockage 10km from the center of Luxor the week prior to our arrival and was difficult to locate. Our driver had to ask directions to find it. Overall the Crown Prince is a good ship, however it is tired and needs major work. The tile in our bathroom was missing grout, sealant was missing in the shower and the water temperature in the shower continuously changed while showering. There are few electrical outlets in the room and I was forced to disconnect a light to set up a charging station for our cell phones. At one point, the ship also developed engine trouble and we ended up not stopping at Kom Ombo, as we arrived there after the site had closed. This was disappointing! I realized that all of the Nile cruise ships were being run 24/7, with no down time. This again attests to phenomenal work by the crew to make the cruise run as smoothly as it did. Overall, it was still a good experience."

Whilst the 5 day formula may be ideal for those arriving and departing from the airport directly, bear in mind that the ship doesn't actually sail until day 2 and is already at its destination on the 3rd night - so, if you spend time visiting sites on your own before/after the cruise, some of the time on board may seem redundant.

The outdoor area and pools are great, in particular we really liked the infinity pool, its quieter and has a great sunset view. Plenty of space to sit around the pool and the hammocks are so comfortable I had a nap. The staff around the pool are really attentive with offering plenty of towels.

I enjoyed outdoors a lot, there is a nice pool and an infinity pool at SPA area. Staff was very kind, helpful and attentive - I ordered caramel frappucino but I got watery and not so nice coffee. A man came up to me later saying he’s a bar manager and asked how I find food and beverage so I was honest and said I’m disappointed with this iced coffee, he apologized and said he will make one for me himself the way it should be which is with whipped cream and actual caramel. It was great and I highly appreciated that. Not only that but there were many amazing other people that made this stay great for me. There were disappointments for this price though and I will list it below.","The rooms are seriously past their usage date and by that I mean for a 5 star hotel and such price they shouldn’t look so used, dirty and similar to rooms I used to rent in Thailand for 20$ a night. They were clean but very used, dirty walls, doors, mirrors, corners, rust and shower head literally fell apart in my hands while I was showering, I regret not taking a picture of it. I put it together somehow and it worked but it shouldn’t have happened and that’s a big shame. Food I would say was also just ok, breakfast as well just ok, in terms of taste and freshness. Another point is SPA. Insanely overpriced and extremely mediocre, I was hugely disappointed with my massage (she checked her phone while massaging, probably for the time but I found it unprofessional and never happened to me in other hotels) and massage itself was not so great, not anything special it was just ok, my boyfriend could do the same but for almost 200$ it shouldn’t be that way. I was expecting something amazing as well for seeing all those awards all over the place. I will leave my honest review here since I didn’t say that to the staff when asked how was my treatment, my boyfriend was next to me and he gifted me this massage so i said it was good because I didn’t want him to feel bad for doing something nice for me. I do not recommend."

We recently stayed at a stunning hotel in Luxor along the Nile. The staff in the kitchen and restaurant were amazing, delivering exceptional service and delicious meals. They made us feel so so welcome and helped us make our vlogs super personal! The beautiful spa and top-notch facilities, including a well-equipped gym and inviting swimming pool, made our stay incredibly relaxing. Highly recommended for a luxurious and rejuvenating escape!

Sayed will be your contact person for the entire cruise and he is truly exceptional. From greeting you in person on the day, to personalising your tour options, Sayed takes genuine care of you and is contactable with any questions at any time. 

When you book this cruise you will be on a boat with other people that have booked the same cruise through various tour agencies at double the price! A couple we became friends with had paid AUS $3,800 through Viator for the same cruise (ours was AUS $1,600 through booking.com, saving us AUS $2,200 less than everyone else!) 

Just a few examples of Sayed’s customer service include providing us a SIM card for internet access the entire cruise (which other couples did not have) providing us washing powder free of charge, and also providing us 6 large bottles of water on arrival. 

This is certainly a more budget friendly cruise option, however if you are looking for something more luxurious I would recommend sending Sayed a direct message and he will be able to provide you with the options of all the boat direct to you (this cuts out the middle man such as tour agencies) and made our cruise cost of other guests! 

The tours arranged by Sayed (including all drivers and guides) were great. The highlight was our tour guide at Luxor! 

Thank you very much again to Sayed for organising the trip!","A few things to note about the boat Royal Ruby - all inclusive does not include any drinks or water. When speaking with a group of people at our dinner table 2 rooms did not have working toilets, and all 4 rooms did not have any hot water on the final day. The rooms are quite small, the beds like most places are two singles pushed together which isn’t the most comfy, and the boat also has strange odours on several floors, however the service is great. The buffet each day was extensive, and take away breakfasts are packed for days you need to leave early for tours. We highly recommend you add the hot air balloon experience in Luxor, it was amazing!"

Thanks to Mr. Sayed, through whom we coordinated everything, for his great and ongoing communication, attention to detail and going above & beyond to ensure we had a wonderful trip. 
First time in Egypt and this Nile cruise hit all the major spots from Aswan to Luxor with excellent, informative Egyptologist tour guides, comfortable accommodations, excellent food and the best staff! 

Our cruise was aboard the Nile Capital (after conferring with Mr. Sayed to determine which cruise ship best fit our needs), and we had the best (quiet) rooms with excellent views from our large windows. The staff aboard the ship were wonderful and accommodating! They truly made sure we enjoyed every second we were on the ship. Food was very good with a variety of options and changing lunch/dinner menus. Kids greatly enjoyed the pool and we enjoyed drinks while coasting along the Nile. 

The tour guides arrived promptly for each tour, were very informative and helpful, and also accommodating to our youngish kids who were hot and tired and at times had trouble concentrating!

Lastly - Mr. Sayed was absolutely wonderful- if there was anything we wanted or needed we knew we could reach out to him! The wonderful sunset felucca ride was the icing on the cake. We cannot wait to return to Egypt (so much more to see than we could accomplish in the one trip) and will definitely be reaching out to Mr. Sayed directly to help arrange all our needs!

The buffet included in the package was overall delicious with variety of options to choose from every day. I was very sceptical whether this booking is going to be like a scam, but everything turned out well. 

Some info for the future guests reading my review: I booked 3 nights starting from Aswan to Luxor. The tour package is not included in the fare and costs $250 + $35 tips per person with a guide that speaks German and English recommended by the cruise. The guide took us to all the must see sights and explained the basic stuffs. Quite a lot of upselling during the tour to convince us to buy additional tours but not too pushy. Overall, I would say it is still worth having a guide as he kept us away from all the hassles on the street. Meal on the ship starts at around 6.30/13.00/19.30 and drinks are not included in the package. But drinks are priced fairly. Tips were collected centrally at the end of the trip and guest can place the tips (recommended $5 per person per night) in a mailbox which will then be distributed to the entire staffs.","Overall the ship and facility needs renovation. No slippers included in the room as the carpet is dirty and outdated. The information is not widely available online about the ships schedule, tour package, and it's docking station. Better communication about those things will gain more trust from the tourists. Depends on where your room locates, sound insulation could be an issue. Bring some earplugs with you to sleep better. Also, if your are vegan, this cruise is not for you."

We did the 7-day tour and as we only booked on booking.com we didn't have a dedicated tour guide that accompanied us (like other guests that booked with a tour operator), but that way we had our own private guide(s) in our language when visiting sights which was extremely nice and comfortable! Also the cruise management at the reception made sure we knew when and what was on our daily plan. 
We had a nice room, enough space and the daily housekeeping did a fantastic job! We liked that you can open the big windows in your room to sit and enjoy the green river banks passing by. The bathroom was clean and big enough (remember your still on a boat). 
As previous comments said, yes, it can happen that another boat is next to you but for us it was only shortly. 
The food is open buffet with great quality and selection of different dietary options (dietary options not really marked but you can always ask the staff). For instance we're both vegetarian and we had more than enough options for every meal. Abdul was our waiter and so very kind!!
I'd like to highlight that every staff member on the boat was super nice and helpful! 
I think you can do the 4-day itinerary too but then your days are packed. Depends on our time but for us 7-days were fine and we would choose same again.","- sundeck could be improved to be more cozy (like add some decoration/plants or so)
- carpet floors in the room could need a high performance vacuum cleaning treatment 
- be aware that you stay in Luxor and Aswan for consecutive days and so don't change location every day 
- be aware it's not an ecological way of transport as generators have to run 24/7"

Our stay at the Sofitel Winter Palace in Luxor was nothing short of extraordinary. This hotel, a converted 19th-century winter palace, exudes a timeless elegance that transports you to a bygone era. While the term “palace” may evoke images of castles or fairy-tale grandeur, the Winter Palace is instead a magnificent example of refined luxury—a stately, grand residence steeped in history and charm.

Location and Grounds
Nestled on the banks of the Nile, the property boasts expansive grounds featuring some of the most exquisite gardens we’ve ever seen. These meticulously maintained gardens are a true highlight, creating an oasis of tranquility in the heart of Luxor. Whether strolling among the lush greenery or relaxing by the inviting pool, we found the outdoor spaces to be a perfect complement to the hotel’s regal interiors.

Timeless Elegance
The Sofitel Winter Palace retains much of its late 19th- and early 20th-century character, making it a visual delight. The hotel’s interiors are filled with elegant touches: opulent chandeliers, richly crafted furniture, and intimate, atmospheric spaces. The bar, with its dark wood and leather furnishings, evokes the era of the British Empire, offering a warm and nostalgic ambiance. The vast salon area—a grand room reminiscent of a scene from Downton Abbey—is a place where you want to linger, read, or simply soak in the history. Nearly every corner of the hotel invites you to stop and take a photo, capturing its timeless beauty.

Accommodations and Dining
Our room, overlooking the Nile, was equally charming, blending classic design with modern comforts. The sunsets over the river were magical, and we spent our evenings on the front veranda, enjoying drinks and watching the day fade away.

The hotel features a highly regarded French-style restaurant with a formal dress code, which we regrettably did not have the opportunity to try.",No Negative Feedback

The minibar does not work like any other hotel we have ever been to - they do NOT stock it or apparently take note of what you have used! We certainly did not realise this until paying the final bill and making the assumption items used had been added. Unfortunately the receptionist was not too kindly when the error was discovered. It would be great if the hotel made this more obvious than it was - unfortunate end to a fab stay.

"M/S Nephtis Nile Cruise (Cruise), Luxor (Egypt) deals",M/S Nephtis Nile Cruise,Marianne,Denmark,4 nights · ,October 2024,Solo traveller,Triple Room with Private Bathroom,Reviewed: 21 October 2024,"IT's a SCAM. The GTS Cairo Group own or lease rooms on several cruise ships sailing on the Nile. We had booked a 3-persons room with balcony on M/S Nephtis Nile Cruise (specifice because of the balcony and 3-person room 28m2 which not many Nile cruises offer).
We were picked up in Luxsor Airport by a staff member of GTS. He was in a hurry getting us out of the airport and keept mention the name Royal Ruby. We told him that we had booked cruise on Nephtis. He looked very confused and called the his office. He informed us that Nephtis wasn't sailing and we had been ""upgraded"" to 5* ship Royal Ruby WITHOUT our KNOWLEDGE or ACCEPT.
Arriving on the ship his focuse was getting paid CASH the amount we had accepted booking our room at Nephtis BEFORE we were showed our new room.
Once the payment was made we were taken to our room. It was ONE 2-pers room 21m2 with no balcony (only a sliding window) and an extra bed squeezed in. We immidiatly got hold of the GTS man and complained about the room size, the missing balcony. He called the GTS office and I got a lady (Rasha) on the phone who couldn't/wouldn't understand/see the issue. We had been ""upgraded"" to a 5* ship and were therefore was NOT entiteled to compentation or reimbursment of the price difference (usd 714,-) between the Nephtis and Royal Ruby.
During our 4 night/5 day stay we tried several time to get in contact with someone on the ship (no one had any authorit) and when we finaly got in contact with GTS Office they insisted that we was NOT entiteled to compensation or reimbursment as 3 persons CAN NOT book/stay in a 2-pers room and we therefor would be charged for 2X 2-pers rooms though we ONLY had ONE 2-person room where we stayed the full cruise.","Looking a reviews for Nephtis Nile Cruise at Booking.com there only a few saying almost nothing. On other sites we have found that we're not the only ones who had been ""upgraded"" to other 5* ships (Rammes 2 - Samirames 1 etc) 
I starting to doubt that M/S Nephtis exist at all.
The service and food on board Royal Ruby was awfull. Very few of the cruise staff speak english, the entertainment at night was non existing and the Food was the same every day/night."

The crew was amazing and no request went unfulfilled. Everything was done with a smile and sincere warmth. Meals were served buffet style and were wonderful. So many choices! Also included was a carving station, fresh pasta station and an egg/omelette/crepe station. Drinks during lunch and dinner were not included, but very reasonably priced. We opted to purchase the optional tour package at $250 a piece. Great decision, as there were only two other clients and we were provided admission, transportation and a professional guide during our visits to all the historic sites. It was well worth it!","The Crown Prince was relocated to dockage 10km from the center of Luxor the week prior to our arrival and was difficult to locate. Our driver had to ask directions to find it. Overall the Crown Prince is a good ship, however it is tired and needs major work. The tile in our bathroom was missing grout, sealant was missing in the shower and the water temperature in the shower continuously changed while showering. There are few electrical outlets in the room and I was forced to disconnect a light to set up a charging station for our cell phones. At one point, the ship also developed engine trouble and we ended up not stopping at Kom Ombo, as we arrived there after the site had closed. This was disappointing! I realized that all of the Nile cruise ships were being run 24/7, with no down time. This again attests to phenomenal work by the crew to make the cruise run as smoothly as it did. Overall, it was still a good experience."

We did not book the excursion package as this was very expensive in comparison with the actual cost. We made all our excursions on our own and managed fine at less than 3rd of the price/person.
The international atmosphere on board was very nice and allthough the itinerary was with 'Egyptian' times, we enjoyed the actual cruising very much. It is very relaxing to sit on deck (trying to stay out of direct sun) and read a book about the old Egyptian civilization and seeing the landscape go back that is described in the same book.... Just wonderful.","Sundeck should also have section with chaise longs in a constant shadow so that people don't have to move and look for that one place without direct sun!! 
What I definately not like is the fact that I requested a 'quiet' room and I get the room right under the dance floor?!! 
Most of the time we are docked between other boats which means we hardly ever can leave our curtains open en enjoy the view. Being in our room means ALWAYS sitting in artificial light. 
Also pictures on booking.com definately not match the reality. 'What's wrong with the picture' is definately a question we can ask ourselves. 
Location in Luxor is very misleading. Far away from the center and the front of the Luxor Temple!!"

Each room has its little garden with two chairs and a table, you can take lengthy walks between the beautiful and unique trees or along the nile at the edge of the island, the plants are unique and exquisite. Three large pools, endless sunbeds and seating options throughout the huge gardens, activities for every age and every person whether a zoo for the children or kids play areas, spa with massages, aerobics and pilates classes, chess and fishing activities - so much to do at the hotel. The location is amazing as you’re in the middle of the nile away from the noise but at the same time it is very well connected to the city either via taxis that are lined up outside the hotel or 2 shuttle busses for free.","The food quality is not good. I stayed at this hotel several times before with my mother (booking was always under her name), and the thing we enjoyed the most was the food, it was delicious.
This time the experience was very disappointing. The variety itself is big and good, but the tase and quality are bad. The bread is very stale, three breakfasts and it was always stale as if it was bread from the previous days. At Dinner, the variety was not the best but it was okay-ish. The taste was again not good, the food is bland, a lot of seasoning is missing. We were very disappointed because Felucca Restaurant was one of our highlights, we loved the breakfast and dinner there everytime we stayed. This time it was not good at all. The Italian restaurant was good however."

Whilst the 5 day formula may be ideal for those arriving and departing from the airport directly, bear in mind that the ship doesn't actually sail until day 2 and is already at its destination on the 3rd night - so, if you spend time visiting sites on your own before/after the cruise, some of the time on board may seem redundant.

The room is clean and comfortable, the only issue we had was the TV doesn't screen mirror using apple devices, you must have an android phone. The outdoor area and pools are great, in particular we really liked the infinity pool, its quieter and has a great sunset view. Plenty of space to sit around the pool and the hammocks are so comfortable I had a nap. The staff around the pool are really attentive with offering plenty of towels. The food is great at the restaurant and pricing is decent. The spa is amazing, we got a room overlooking the Nile and massages were great, the other spa facilities and sauna are also really nice.

I enjoyed outdoors a lot, there is a nice pool and an infinity pool at SPA area. Staff was very kind, helpful and attentive - I ordered caramel frappucino but I got watery and not so nice coffee. A man came up to me later saying he’s a bar manager and asked how I find food and beverage so I was honest and said I’m disappointed with this iced coffee, he apologized and said he will make one for me himself the way it should be which is with whipped cream and actual caramel. It was great and I highly appreciated that. Not only that but there were many amazing other people that made this stay great for me. There were disappointments for this price though and I will list it below.","The rooms are seriously past their usage date and by that I mean for a 5 star hotel and such price they shouldn’t look so used, dirty and similar to rooms I used to rent in Thailand for 20$ a night. They were clean but very used, dirty walls, doors, mirrors, corners, rust and shower head literally fell apart in my hands while I was showering, I regret not taking a picture of it. I put it together somehow and it worked but it shouldn’t have happened and that’s a big shame. Food I would say was also just ok, breakfast as well just ok, in terms of taste and freshness. Another point is SPA. Insanely overpriced and extremely mediocre, I was hugely disappointed with my massage (she checked her phone while massaging, probably for the time but I found it unprofessional and never happened to me in other hotels) and massage itself was not so great, not anything special it was just ok, my boyfriend could do the same but for almost 200$ it shouldn’t be that way. I was expecting something amazing as well for seeing all those awards all over the place. I will leave my honest review here since I didn’t say that to the staff when asked how was my treatment, my boyfriend was next to me and he gifted me this massage so i said it was good because I didn’t want him to feel bad for doing something nice for me. I do not recommend."

Ahmed at the front desk is the best in the business. He was extremely quick to respond to all our requests and helped us book taxis, balloon rides, meals, etc. He even bent over backwards to get a crib for our baby, sourcing one from across town and putting it together himself. The restaurant has the best food in Egypt. Chef Hassan is an incredible man who loves what he does. It's worth staying here for the food alone. And breakfast was included! Spent our evenings watching the sunset from the spectacular rooftop terrace. Far from town but easy to get to town and there are great markets and restaurants within walking distance. Got to be the best place in Luxor.",The water heaters are not big enough for the villa rooms. Only the first 2 people to shower would get hot water.

Sayed will be your contact person for the entire cruise and he is truly exceptional. From greeting you in person on the day, to personalising your tour options, Sayed takes genuine care of you and is contactable with any questions at any time. 

When you book this cruise you will be on a boat with other people that have booked the same cruise through various tour agencies at double the price! A couple we became friends with had paid AUS $3,800 through Viator for the same cruise (ours was AUS $1,600 through booking.com, saving us AUS $2,200 less than everyone else!) 

Just a few examples of Sayed’s customer service include providing us a SIM card for internet access the entire cruise (which other couples did not have) providing us washing powder free of charge, and also providing us 6 large bottles of water on arrival. 

This is certainly a more budget friendly cruise option, however if you are looking for something more luxurious I would recommend sending Sayed a direct message and he will be able to provide you with the options of all the boat direct to you (this cuts out the middle man such as tour agencies) and made our cruise cost of other guests! 

The tours arranged by Sayed (including all drivers and guides) were great. The highlight was our tour guide at Luxor! 

Thank you very much again to Sayed for organising the trip!","A few things to note about the boat Royal Ruby - all inclusive does not include any drinks or water. When speaking with a group of people at our dinner table 2 rooms did not have working toilets, and all 4 rooms did not have any hot water on the final day. The rooms are quite small, the beds like most places are two singles pushed together which isn’t the most comfy, and the boat also has strange odours on several floors, however the service is great. The buffet each day was extensive, and take away breakfasts are packed for days you need to leave early for tours. We highly recommend you add the hot air balloon experience in Luxor, it was amazing!"

First time in Egypt and this Nile cruise hit all the major spots from Aswan to Luxor with excellent, informative Egyptologist tour guides, comfortable accommodations, excellent food and the best staff! 

Our cruise was aboard the Nile Capital (after conferring with Mr. Sayed to determine which cruise ship best fit our needs), and we had the best (quiet) rooms with excellent views from our large windows. The staff aboard the ship were wonderful and accommodating! They truly made sure we enjoyed every second we were on the ship. Food was very good with a variety of options and changing lunch/dinner menus. Kids greatly enjoyed the pool and we enjoyed drinks while coasting along the Nile. 

The tour guides arrived promptly for each tour, were very informative and helpful, and also accommodating to our youngish kids who were hot and tired and at times had trouble concentrating!

Lastly - Mr. Sayed was absolutely wonderful- if there was anything we wanted or needed we knew we could reach out to him! The wonderful sunset felucca ride was the icing on the cake. We cannot wait to return to Egypt (so much more to see than we could accomplish in the one trip) and will definitely be reaching out to Mr. Sayed directly to help arrange all our needs!

The buffet included in the package was overall delicious with variety of options to choose from every day. I was very sceptical whether this booking is going to be like a scam, but everything turned out well. 

Some info for the future guests reading my review: I booked 3 nights starting from Aswan to Luxor. The tour package is not included in the fare and costs $250 + $35 tips per person with a guide that speaks German and English recommended by the cruise. The guide took us to all the must see sights and explained the basic stuffs. Quite a lot of upselling during the tour to convince us to buy additional tours but not too pushy. Overall, I would say it is still worth having a guide as he kept us away from all the hassles on the street. Meal on the ship starts at around 6.30/13.00/19.30 and drinks are not included in the package. But drinks are priced fairly. Tips were collected centrally at the end of the trip and guest can place the tips (recommended $5 per person per night) in a mailbox which will then be distributed to the entire staffs.","Overall the ship and facility needs renovation. No slippers included in the room as the carpet is dirty and outdated. The information is not widely available online about the ships schedule, tour package, and it's docking station. Better communication about those things will gain more trust from the tourists. Depends on where your room locates, sound insulation could be an issue. Bring some earplugs with you to sleep better. Also, if your are vegan, this cruise is not for you."

We did the 7-day tour and as we only booked on booking.com we didn't have a dedicated tour guide that accompanied us (like other guests that booked with a tour operator), but that way we had our own private guide(s) in our language when visiting sights which was extremely nice and comfortable! Also the cruise management at the reception made sure we knew when and what was on our daily plan. 
We had a nice room, enough space and the daily housekeeping did a fantastic job! We liked that you can open the big windows in your room to sit and enjoy the green river banks passing by. The bathroom was clean and big enough (remember your still on a boat). 
As previous comments said, yes, it can happen that another boat is next to you but for us it was only shortly. 
The food is open buffet with great quality and selection of different dietary options (dietary options not really marked but you can always ask the staff). For instance we're both vegetarian and we had more than enough options for every meal. Abdul was our waiter and so very kind!!
I'd like to highlight that every staff member on the boat was super nice and helpful! 
I think you can do the 4-day itinerary too but then your days are packed. Depends on our time but for us 7-days were fine and we would choose same again.","- sundeck could be improved to be more cozy (like add some decoration/plants or so)
- carpet floors in the room could need a high performance vacuum cleaning treatment

Our stay at the Sofitel Winter Palace in Luxor was nothing short of extraordinary. This hotel, a converted 19th-century winter palace, exudes a timeless elegance that transports you to a bygone era. While the term “palace” may evoke images of castles or fairy-tale grandeur, the Winter Palace is instead a magnificent example of refined luxury—a stately, grand residence steeped in history and charm.

Location and Grounds
Nestled on the banks of the Nile, the property boasts expansive grounds featuring some of the most exquisite gardens we’ve ever seen. These meticulously maintained gardens are a true highlight, creating an oasis of tranquility in the heart of Luxor. Whether strolling among the lush greenery or relaxing by the inviting pool, we found the outdoor spaces to be a perfect complement to the hotel’s regal interiors.

Timeless Elegance
The Sofitel Winter Palace retains much of its late 19th- and early 20th-century character, making it a visual delight. The hotel’s interiors are filled with elegant touches: opulent chandeliers, richly crafted furniture, and intimate, atmospheric spaces. The bar, with its dark wood and leather furnishings, evokes the era of the British Empire, offering a warm and nostalgic ambiance. The vast salon area—a grand room reminiscent of a scene from Downton Abbey—is a place where you want to linger, read, or simply soak in the history. Nearly every corner of the hotel invites you to stop and take a photo, capturing its timeless beauty.

Accommodations and Dining
Our room, overlooking the Nile, was equally charming, blending classic design with modern comforts. The sunsets over the river were magical, and we spent our evenings on the front veranda, enjoying drinks and watching the day fade away.

The hotel features a highly regarded French-style restaurant with a formal dress code, which we regrettably did not have the opportunity to try.",No Negative Feedback

The minibar does not work like any other hotel we have ever been to - they do NOT stock it or apparently take note of what you have used! We certainly did not realise this until paying the final bill and making the assumption items used had been added. Unfortunately the receptionist was not too kindly when the error was discovered. It would be great if the hotel made this more obvious than it was - unfortunate end to a fab stay.

I'm vegan but don't shout about it and just accommodate but when the restaurant found out they went out of their way to provide the most delicious food I can eat.

The room was way more luxurious than I expected and the bed super comfy.

Housekeeping was great and room super clean.

Don't ask for the Nile view, choose the shore side, you'll see more.

None of the trips are included. They want you to pay $250 extra to take a guide for the 3 days but I did it without, just taking local taxis and using local guides - way cheaper and keeps the money in the towns.","Hmmm.... the price quoted on Booking.com was NOT the price I ended up paying - I ended up paying almost a £100 more but there wasn't much I could do about that.

A kettle in the room would be good.

I live in Egypt and quite savvy to the street hustles but got scammed by a worker from the boat who saw me on the street and said 'hi'. I only wanted directions to a pharmacy but of course i got 'guided' to his local spice shop and scammed into paying way over the odds for teas i didn't want/ need and then he asked for more baksheesh (tips) on top.

The GTS Cairo Group own or lease rooms on several cruise ships sailing on the Nile. We had booked a 3-persons room with balcony on M/S Nephtis Nile Cruise (specifice because of the balcony and 3-person room 28m2 which not many Nile cruises offer).
We were picked up in Luxsor Airport by a staff member of GTS. He was in a hurry getting us out of the airport and keept mention the name Royal Ruby. We told him that we had booked cruise on Nephtis. He looked very confused and called the his office. He informed us that Nephtis wasn't sailing and we had been ""upgraded"" to 5* ship Royal Ruby WITHOUT our KNOWLEDGE or ACCEPT.
Arriving on the ship his focuse was getting paid CASH the amount we had accepted booking our room at Nephtis BEFORE we were showed our new room.
Once the payment was made we were taken to our room. It was ONE 2-pers room 21m2 with no balcony (only a sliding window) and an extra bed squeezed in. We immidiatly got hold of the GTS man and complained about the room size, the missing balcony. He called the GTS office and I got a lady (Rasha) on the phone who couldn't/wouldn't understand/see the issue. We had been ""upgraded"" to a 5* ship and were therefore was NOT entiteled to compentation or reimbursment of the price difference (usd 714,-) between the Nephtis and Royal Ruby.
During our 4 night/5 day stay we tried several time to get in contact with someone on the ship (no one had any authorit) and when we finaly got in contact with GTS Office they insisted that we was NOT entiteled to compensation or reimbursment as 3 persons CAN NOT book/stay in a 2-pers room and we therefor would be charged for 2X 2-pers rooms though we ONLY had ONE 2-person room where we stayed the full cruise.","Looking a reviews for Nephtis Nile Cruise at Booking.com there only a few saying almost nothing. On other sites we have found that we're not the only ones who had been ""upgraded"" to other 5* ships (Rammes 2 - Samirames 1 etc) 
I starting to doubt that M/S Nephtis exist at all.
The service and food on board Royal Ruby was awfull. Very few of the cruise staff speak english, the entertainment at night was non existing and the Food was the same every day/night."

The crew was amazing and no request went unfulfilled. Everything was done with a smile and sincere warmth. Meals were served buffet style and were wonderful. So many choices! Also included was a carving station, fresh pasta station and an egg/omelette/crepe station. Drinks during lunch and dinner were not included, but very reasonably priced. We opted to purchase the optional tour package at $250 a piece. Great decision, as there were only two other clients and we were provided admission, transportation and a professional guide during our visits to all the historic sites. It was well worth it!","The Crown Prince was relocated to dockage 10km from the center of Luxor the week prior to our arrival and was difficult to locate. Our driver had to ask directions to find it. Overall the Crown Prince is a good ship, however it is tired and needs major work. The tile in our bathroom was missing grout, sealant was missing in the shower and the water temperature in the shower continuously changed while showering. There are few electrical outlets in the room and I was forced to disconnect a light to set up a charging station for our cell phones. At one point, the ship also developed engine trouble and we ended up not stopping at Kom Ombo, as we arrived there after the site had closed. This was disappointing! I realized that all of the Nile cruise ships were being run 24/7, with no down time. This again attests to phenomenal work by the crew to make the cruise run as smoothly as it did. Overall, it was still a good experience."

We did not book the excursion package as this was very expensive in comparison with the actual cost. We made all our excursions on our own and managed fine at less than 3rd of the price/person.
The international atmosphere on board was very nice and allthough the itinerary was with 'Egyptian' times, we enjoyed the actual cruising very much. It is very relaxing to sit on deck (trying to stay out of direct sun) and read a book about the old Egyptian civilization and seeing the landscape go back that is described in the same book.... Just wonderful.","Sundeck should also have section with chaise longs in a constant shadow so that people don't have to move and look for that one place without direct sun!! 
What I definately not like is the fact that I requested a 'quiet' room and I get the room right under the dance floor?!! 
Most of the time we are docked between other boats which means we hardly ever can leave our curtains open en enjoy the view. Being in our room means ALWAYS sitting in artificial light. 
Also pictures on booking.com definately not match the reality. 'What's wrong with the picture' is definately a question we can ask ourselves. 
Location in Luxor is very misleading. Far away from the center and the front of the Luxor Temple!!"

Then they didn't give us the correct name of the dock that the boat was leaving from, or any check-in instructions. The driver got lost, they didn't answer the phone, it was really stressful. There are no tea/coffee-making facilities in the room, and the decor is a bit dated. They changed dinner times on a whim and the seemed to decide on the day what the program was."

El Gouna offers plenty of activities (golf, tennis, padel, karting, snorkling) but the large pool at the hotel is so inviting we basically chilled there every day with the occasional kitesurfing and volleybal session - there's a volleybal court and Duotone kite center on site. The staff is super nice, fun and engaging - we knew them by name after two days. There's magazines, chess, checkers and backgammon boards at the pool and a guy handing out shishas. The crowd is quite young, mostly 30/35 year old couples. The food is the best we've had in Egypt. The spa is also great, has its own pool, sauna and steam room. Highly recommend, will be back!","Honestly can't think of many negative points... The Duotone center is expensive they charge 150 euro for one day of rental but it goes down as you book more days. Great service though, they pump your kite, set the lines and help launching. The hotel was built in 2019 so some aspects of the interior might use a little repainting or renovation but don't think most people would notice."

Resort is also very big so feels less cozy (like massive swimming pools with apartment buildings on opposite sides). During our stay maintenance work was going on like painting in our corridors and lobby areas with resultant paint dust!
Evening entertainment average! Bookable “Wow restaurant” not worth it for vegetarians as only one set menu everyday! Overall just felt like a conveyor belt of tourists coming and going."

We often like to spend our vacations in a hotel in Soma Bay because we love the area. During our recent stay, we decided to extend our trip by one more night, so we booked this apartment as it was much cheaper than staying in the hotel.

I must say, it was an exceptional experience. The apartment was very spacious, immaculately clean, well-maintained, and beautifully furnished with brand new furniture and a well-equipped kitchen, offering all the conveniences one could ask for. It truly felt like a home away from home. We also loved the pool table on the terrace. The location of the apartment was fantastic, with a stunning panoramic view of the sea.

Additionally, we had free access to the “S.CAPE” beach and the heated swimming pool downstairs, which was a wonderful bonus, providing a perfect spot for relaxation and water activities.

Our host, Midu, was incredibly helpful and welcoming, ensuring that our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. He also offered us a transfer to the airport with an SUV for a very affordable price, which we accepted.


Overall, I highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a memorable stay in Soma Bay. It truly exceeded our expectations in every way. We cannot wait to come back! and we will not book a hotel this time we will book this amazing apartment😍.",No Negative Feedback

The small details like comfortable mattresses and having chargers next to the beds were great. Also, the outdoor swimming pool is heated so can be used anytime of year.

You must accept typical street noises which is pleasant to some degree
Inefficient AC, please come in the wintertime

Doors let many noises, it is best when you book outside hot season as you will live far away from elevator

As a summary: good when it is 25C, when there are few tourists, for budget and frequent touring through marina. For travellers as main base for exploration,","The rooms were NOT cleaned daily by default as in other budget hotels
The breakfast is not for european taste in geneal, what is worse the service is very slow - not worth it
Certain equipment is missing: safe bolted to the back of bookshelf instead of wall etc
No shelf for soap in the shower, and the curtain too short means lots of water sprinkles around
The table is very small, not for reading, not for laptop, not for 2 people
ELEVATOR IS DANGEROUS always check if it is BEHIND the door when you open it!

Compared to PalmInn: cleaning frequency was worse, sound proofing worse, table worse, bathroom equipment vey slightly worse, safety much worse (elevator). I advise Lamera for adults, PalmInn for families"

El Gouna offers plenty of activities (golf, tennis, padel, karting, snorkling) but the large pool at the hotel is so inviting we basically chilled there every day with the occasional kitesurfing and volleybal session - there's a volleybal court and Duotone kite center on site. The staff is super nice, fun and engaging - we knew them by name after two days. There's magazines, chess, checkers and backgammon boards at the pool and a guy handing out shishas. The crowd is quite young, mostly 30/35 year old couples. The food is the best we've had in Egypt. The spa is also great, has its own pool, sauna and steam room. Highly recommend, will be back!","Honestly can't think of many negative points... The Duotone center is expensive they charge 150 euro for one day of rental but it goes down as you book more days. Great service though, they pump your kite, set the lines and help launching. The hotel was built in 2019 so some aspects of the interior might use a little repainting or renovation but don't think most people would notice."

close to other amenities such as the shopping mall, beach, marina etc.

It truly felt like a home away from home. We also loved the pool table on the terrace. The location of the apartment was fantastic, with a stunning panoramic view of the sea.

Additionally, we had free access to the “S.CAPE” beach and the heated swimming pool downstairs, which was a wonderful bonus, providing a perfect spot for relaxation and water activities.

Our host, Midu, was incredibly helpful and welcoming, ensuring that our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. He also offered us a transfer to the airport with an SUV for a very affordable price, which we accepted.

You must accept typical street noises which is pleasant to some degree
Inefficient AC, please come in the wintertime
There is only very small table
Doors let many noises, it is best when you book outside hot season as you will live far away from elevator

As a summary: good when it is 25C, when there are few tourists, for budget and frequent touring through marina. For travellers as main base for exploration,","The rooms were NOT cleaned daily by default as in other budget hotels
The breakfast is not for european taste in geneal, what is worse the service is very slow - not worth it
Certain equipment is missing: safe bolted to the back of bookshelf instead of wall etc
No shelf for soap in the shower, and the curtain too short means lots of water sprinkles around
The table is very small, not for reading, not for laptop, not for 2 people
ELEVATOR IS DANGEROUS always check if it is BEHIND the door when you open it!

Compared to PalmInn: cleaning frequency was worse, sound proofing worse, table worse, bathroom equipment vey slightly worse, safety much worse (elevator). I advise Lamera for adults, PalmInn for families"

Thankfully I was leaving the next day so I just bough some medicine at the pharmacy myself later. So be careful. Also the taxi drivers from the front door will try to ask you for 25 euro fee to the airport or bus station. When Uber only charges 4-5 euro. Sure the uber driver might ask you for more.

El Gouna offers plenty of activities (golf, tennis, padel, karting, snorkling) but the large pool at the hotel is so inviting we basically chilled there every day with the occasional kitesurfing and volleybal session - there's a volleybal court and Duotone kite center on site. The staff is super nice, fun and engaging - we knew them by name after two days. There's magazines, chess, checkers and backgammon boards at the pool and a guy handing out shishas. The crowd is quite young, mostly 30/35 year old couples. The food is the best we've had in Egypt. The spa is also great, has its own pool, sauna and steam room. Highly recommend, will be back!","Honestly can't think of many negative points... The Duotone center is expensive they charge 150 euro for one day of rental but it goes down as you book more days. Great service though, they pump your kite, set the lines and help launching. The hotel was built in 2019 so some aspects of the interior might use a little repainting or renovation but don't think most people would notice."

Resort is also very big so feels less cozy (like massive swimming pools with apartment buildings on opposite sides). During our stay maintenance work was going on like painting in our corridors and lobby areas with resultant paint dust!
Evening entertainment average! Bookable “Wow restaurant” not worth it for vegetarians as only one set menu everyday! Overall just felt like a conveyor belt of tourists coming and going."

close to other amenities such as the shopping mall, beach, marina etc.

We often like to spend our vacations in a hotel in Soma Bay because we love the area. During our recent stay, we decided to extend our trip by one more night, so we booked this apartment as it was much cheaper than staying in the hotel.

I must say, it was an exceptional experience. The apartment was very spacious, immaculately clean, well-maintained, and beautifully furnished with brand new furniture and a well-equipped kitchen, offering all the conveniences one could ask for. It truly felt like a home away from home. We also loved the pool table on the terrace. The location of the apartment was fantastic, with a stunning panoramic view of the sea.

Additionally, we had free access to the “S.CAPE” beach and the heated swimming pool downstairs, which was a wonderful bonus, providing a perfect spot for relaxation and water activities.

Our host, Midu, was incredibly helpful and welcoming, ensuring that our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. He also offered us a transfer to the airport with an SUV for a very affordable price, which we accepted.

"Lamera Hotel (Hotel), Hurghada (Egypt) deals",Lamera Hotel,Mariana,Switzerland,14 nights · ,January 2025,Solo traveller,Single Room with Private Bathroom,Reviewed: 13 January 2025,"I arrived at the hotel, the staff greeted me as if I was meeting friends I hadn't seen for a while. Eman and Fayrouz explained everything about the hotel. I felt respected as a guest and knew I could mention any potential problem which would be solved swiftly. Over the 2 weeks I was there I met the manager Walid and the owner, Mr Mina. The hotel and its guests are in good hands, welcomed and offered great deals with excursions (fabulous at good price), access to beaches, info about well priced restaurants in the area and so on. Ask and you will be heard! I want to thank Gamel also for his help and the night staff who is amazing.
My room was comfortable, good mattress, little balcony, good mirror. 
The breakfast is served from 7am to 12 on the top floor, where you can sit on individual balconies, overlooking the skyline of downtown and the radiant sky. The serving is simple and healthy; they manage to add a change daily, there is a hot item included every day, never the same. The friendliness of the service is the best, even if do not speak Arabic.
I was impressed by the collegial teamwork amongst every worker at Lamera, nothing is too difficult to solve for them. Thank you all for great management and respect for who comes through the door!",The bathroom could do with 2 more hooks

"Lamera Hotel (Hotel), Hurghada (Egypt) deals",Lamera Hotel,Krzysztof,Poland,1 night · ,January 2025,Solo traveller,Single Room with Private Bathroom,Reviewed: 3 January 2025,"The location is best
You must accept typical street noises which is pleasant to some degree
Inefficient AC, please come in the wintertime
There is only very small table
Doors let many noises, it is best when you book outside hot season as you will live far away from elevator

As a summary: good when it is 25C, when there are few tourists, for budget and frequent touring through marina. For travellers as main base for exploration,","The rooms were NOT cleaned daily by default as in other budget hotels
The breakfast is not for european taste in geneal, what is worse the service is very slow - not worth it
Certain equipment is missing: safe bolted to the back of bookshelf instead of wall etc
No shelf for soap in the shower, and the curtain too short means lots of water sprinkles around
The table is very small, not for reading, not for laptop, not for 2 people
ELEVATOR IS DANGEROUS always check if it is BEHIND the door when you open it!

Compared to PalmInn: cleaning frequency was worse, sound proofing worse, table worse, bathroom equipment vey slightly worse, safety much worse (elevator). I advise Lamera for adults, PalmInn for families"

food was good","- room door opens inwards, which can be too dangerous in case of emergency

- shower gel was taken und not replaced. we were almost out of toilet paper and no new rolls were put
- a lamp was not working with no reaction from the hotel although it was reported
- no heating in cold winter
- the balcony door was not sealed and was shaky. Wind goes through too easily, despide closed door. It doesnt isolate the noises from outside. It was too loud and too cold when it was windy
- no sand beach directly to the water. You get into water via concrete stairs
- the hotel lies not directly on the beach. You will have to cross a street to the beach. It takes at least 5 minutes on foot to be at the beach"

So thank you guys!! The resort has a lot of amenities, the views are great! and the food is limitless. Although you can get sick like I did. And the doctor on site will try to rip you off. I only had a sore stomach from food poisoning probably and he wanted me to pay 370 GBP for medicine with the excuse that my insurance could cover it. Thankfully I was leaving the next day so I just bough some medicine at the pharmacy myself later. So be careful. Also the taxi drivers from the front door will try to ask you for 25 euro fee to the airport or bus station. When Uber only charges 4-5 euro. Sure the uber driver might ask you for more. Like they always do in Egypt, but you can negotiate that or don’t necessarily have to do it if you don’t want to.

From the moment we arrived, the staff was welcoming and efficient, ensuring a smooth check-in. The resort's grounds are beautifully maintained, and our room was spacious, modern, and impeccably clean with a lovely balcony view. The guy who was cleaning our room Atef Ashry is really professional and our room was cleaned perfectly.

The variety of pools, including fun water slides and relaxing adult-only areas, catered to all our needs. Dining was a delight, with a wide range of delicious options at the buffet and excellent à la carte restaurants. The themed nights added a great variety to our meals.
The waiter, Ibrahim Gamal, was really professional and always on the service whenever we needed him he was there. Exponential service.

The entertainment team kept us engaged with daily activities and evening shows, and the spa offered a blissful retreat. The beach, accessible via a convenient shuttle, was pristine with clear waters.

Overall, the Pickalbatros Aqua Vista Hotel provided exceptional service, luxurious accommodations, and memorable experiences. I highly recommend it for a perfect getaway in Hurghada","Air-conditioning in the room, they don't have remote its on the wall attached."

The staff were very responsive. We particularly liked the cafeteria that served middle eastern food. 

Our favorite part of the trip, however, were the excursions we took away from the resort: we went to a Bedouin village, we rode dune buggies in the desert, and we snorkeled in the Red Sea. Those were great fun!","Only two of the pools were heated, so those were highly crowded. Our kids would have enjoyed exploring a few more pools if the water was less chilling!"

We booked a family room which contains 2 separate bedrooms and 1 bathroom. 

Our experience has been a very positive one. The hotel is very clean and perfect for anyone looking to visit Hurghada. The location is very close to the airport which was convenient to get to. It is also
close to other amenities such as the shopping mall, beach, marina etc.

The hotel had 3 buffet restaurants and 1 a’la carte restaurant which offered local and international cuisines. We booked the a’la carte restaurant for our daughters birthday and we were received a beautiful surprise from the waiters who sang a birthday song and gave a cake to her.


The swimming pools were heated which allowed us to enjoy and make use of.

Wifi signal and speed was great in anywhere inside the hotel.

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and made our stay very special
and went out of their way to make us happy, particularly staff members 
Hossam in reception, Nader in housekeeping, Mustafa the restaurant manager who was always ready to help us.

All in all, we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Hurghada. 

We will book the hotel again if we plan to holiday in Hurghada Insha Allah.",Nothing

So thank you guys!! The resort has a lot of amenities, the views are great! and the food is limitless. Although you can get sick like I did. And the doctor on site will try to rip you off. I only had a sore stomach from food poisoning probably and he wanted me to pay 370 GBP for medicine with the excuse that my insurance could cover it. Thankfully I was leaving the next day so I just bough some medicine at the pharmacy myself later. So be careful. Also the taxi drivers from the front door will try to ask you for 25 euro fee to the airport or bus station. When Uber only charges 4-5 euro. Sure the uber driver might ask you for more. Like they always do in Egypt, but you can negotiate that or don’t necessarily have to do it if you don’t want to.
