He always supported me in case I needed anything, we were greeted with incredible cleanliness and attention. It was one of the best experiences of my life thanks to him. The slightly dark-skinned guy who carried the drinks at Colonies restaurant made our days more beautiful, never lose him, in fact, if possible, I would like you to give him a raise. I would also like to thank him for his beautiful smile and attention","We were at the hotel around 3-3.30 am because we had a late flight on the first day. We requested an early room because there were a lot of mosquitoes in the waiting area and we were tired. It was not free of charge, which I find very normal, but there were empty rooms ready for your information. We had to pay for an extra day for 3-4 hours of sleep. The air conditioner was broken, but it was fixed on the 2nd day, I did not have any other negative experiences."

The rooms and outdoor spaces are kept clean and the landscaping is expansive with two pool areas and a sunset view of the market street. Fresh omelette for breakfast,"The room walls were whitewashed recently, but the fixtures and furniture are old. The sheets were fresh but also old and have some stains. I had two beds in my room so I was able to choose the less stained one. My room didn't have toilet paper or a towel, but the staff provided both when I asked. Breakfast is a strange affair, nothing is labeled on the buffet o you just need to take a chance and try stuff. After filling your plate a staff member brings a cling film wrapped plate with what looks like day old cheese, ham, tomato and cucumber slices to your table. No wifi in the room, but I bought a sim card from Vodafone for 10 euro."

My stay at Siva Sharm Resort & Spa, though affordable, highlighted several areas for improvement.

Firstly, the state of cleanliness was concerning. Housekeeping was inconsistent and inadequate. Sheets were only changed upon request, and basic amenities like tea and coffee were not replenished. The floors weren't swept; housekeeping simply tidied up, and that was it. Additionally, smoke odors from nearby rooms were bothersome—offering non-smoking rooms could improve this aspect.

Maintenance is also lacking. Many amenities were broken or non-functional, impacting the overall experience.

There was a notable issue with mosquitoes, making it uncomfortable to enjoy outdoor spaces. Effective pest control measures are needed.

Additionally, the pool was not well-maintained and appeared unclean, which was disappointing.

Access to the sea was limited, with only a small area available for use, which may not be suitable for those looking for expansive beach experiences.

The buffet offered limited and repetitive options, lacking variety. Enhancing the meal offerings could significantly boost guest satisfaction.

Overall, while the price is appealing, tackling these issues would greatly improve the experience at Siva Sharm Resort & Spa.

Overall, the hotel offers great value for money, and I’d happily return. The evening entertainment had impressive production value, surpassing many other hotels. There were plenty of restaurants to choose from, and the private beach was a great touch.

The staff were exceptionally welcoming and friendly. Special thanks to:
 • Said at the restaurants, who not only corrected a few order mistakes but also anticipated our needs.
 • Mohammed at Velocity Bar, who always got our drinks right with a smile.
 • The bartender at the large pool (sorry, I didn’t catch his name), who made fantastic mojitos and was always cheerful.","Cons:
 • Cold evenings in February – Outdoor seating is available, but blankets would be a great addition.
 • Chaotic restaurant service – While staff were attentive, food orders were frequently incorrect or missing items. Thankfully, Said was often there to help.
 • Persistent activity staff – The poolside animation and activity sellers could be overwhelming. We later learned that asking the lifeguard for a red flag prevents disturbances."

Overall, the hotel offers great value for money, and I’d happily return. The evening entertainment had impressive production value, surpassing many other hotels. There were plenty of restaurants to choose from, and the private beach was a great touch.

The staff were exceptionally welcoming and friendly. Special thanks to:
 • Said at the restaurants, who not only corrected a few order mistakes but also anticipated our needs.
 • Mohammed at Velocity Bar, who always got our drinks right with a smile.
 • The bartender at the large pool (sorry, I didn’t catch his name), who made fantastic mojitos and was always cheerful.","Cons:
 • Cold evenings in February – Outdoor seating is available, but blankets would be a great addition.
 • Chaotic restaurant service – While staff were attentive, food orders were frequently incorrect or missing items. Thankfully, Said was often there to help.
 • Persistent activity staff – The poolside animation and activity sellers could be overwhelming. We later learned that asking the lifeguard for a red flag prevents disturbances."

Massive resort, if you have mobility issues you may struggle, lots of steps.

Have to pay for wifi if you want in room, 27 dollars 1 week. Wifi in reception (free) but very poor.

Most of the staff was really rude, acted like an all exclusive resort is something that we have to work for. Usually, when we arrive at a resort where all is paid, we dont expect to say no to different offers all the time. Its simply annoying and it ruins the mood. Also, when we went at the beach, only thing we wanted was chill, sun and quiet- what we got was every 20 minutes someone asking us if we want either massage, either souveniours, either a trip, or stretching. An advice to the managers if u really wish to not scare the guests: simply promote thode services as flyers, desks in the lobby and any kind of easy going online information. Cut the hustle, please!

The vast majority of the staff we met were very friendly and welcoming and always tried their hardest to make our holiday experience as positive as possible.
We had excellent service from Mohammed M and Abdullah in the restaurant. We also enjoyed meeting Hatem Wael from the pool lifeguard team. Always available each day with our pool towels and a broad smile - he made us laugh so many times throughout each day. Also thanks to Ali Rashed and his front of house team for their help.
We were always able to find food options to enjoy and all in all had very good value for money for our time at Ghazaala Gardens.","As other reviews point out, the bedrooms/bathrooms are in need of modernisation. But we didn't spend a lot of time in our room so didn't let this bother us."

The staff at the hotel were amazing very helpful and always happy. We went December 2025 All Inclusive the drink was reasonable beer a bit watery but the manager sorted this out with my husband. The heated pool was not very heated and the entertainment was outside. It was cold at night so we could not join in because we sat inside. The food was good always something nice to eat especially the salad selection. Gala New Year Dinner the food was exceptional and the acts were very good. But it was very cold so did not manage to take my Jacket off. The Gazelle Beach was just 5 min walk from the hotel you cross the road and you are there. Sunbeds and bar to make your day enjoyable.
The hotel could do with an upgrade the TV system is old. (They were installing flat screen TV the day we left so they are trying to upgrade.) The Bathroom and toilet need refurbished bit grubby round the edges, but still ok. I would return to the hotel in the future and i would recommend others to go.
Just some tourist notes for travellers.
Bring English pounds with you because the exchange rate is more money.
The weather was lovely in December but cold at night.
Taxi from the airport was a rip off 1200 Egyptian the taxi drivers gather round you outside and put you under pressure. I would recommend book through your Hotel or use this taxi guy he was amazing and does not rip you off 600 Egypt to and from airport TO NAMMA BAY Joe taxi +20 109 4883377 just leave a message on Wasap and he will translate and get back to you. 
When you arrive at the airport get a local sim card the guy puts it in for you i paid £5 and it lasted me the full 2 weeks.
We went on a tour to Ciro by air to see the Pyramids the trip was organised very well and we had a great time. I will return to Shamel Sheik again in the future.",nothing

Could not have been more helpful and attentive to the point where at first I doubted their sincerity but soon realised they are genuinely concerned that you are having the best time. From Yasser in the restaurant who is so kind and for whom nothing odd to much trouble, to Mimi who popped up everywhere just as you needed him, to Ismail who serviced our room so beautifully with his towel art and who constantly kept our building clean and dust free, to the chaps in reception and guest services who were always up for a chat, the whole team really were superb. The reception, restaurants and outside areas are very attractive and picturesque with well maintained gardens and seating areas. The private beach was great with its own restaurant snack lunch included. For a value for money getaway it’s great. Have booked to go back.","All inclusive drinks from the bar lack love… a nice glass, ice, a slice of lemon or lime, or a sprig of basil go a long way. I became a little tired of the repetitive food and how the oil makes everything taste the same, but if you choose wisely, there is decent food to eat. Also the Brazilian restaurant was lovely especially the steak and lobster which you pay extra for but is not expensive and well worth it. Bedrooms were a bit tired… tvs in our two rooms didn’t work but we asked them to be fixed and they did come and do it. Bathrooms were a bit old. Mosquito screens on terrace doors would be a great addition particularly as the aircon is switched off in winter because for them it’s cold, but still feels hot and stuffy for us - sleeping with the window open the first night led to a mosquito frenzy so there wasn’t much option to get cool after that. However I do believe they are gradually updating the rooms so that will help. Free wifi is a little slow and only in lobby but an inexpensive e-sim fixed that problem."

The pools are numerous, and having 3 heated pools, especially the 25M adult pool, is to me a game changer. The cleaning was spotless, and provided fresh beach towels every day.

This is the right place to spend a holiday in total serenity, calm and peace in the company of a good book to read.
Here you will not have anyone asking you if you want to have a massage, a tour in the desert, a boat trip. You will not have anyone asking you to go and play water games in the pool and you will not hear disco music at full volume, all typical things of a village-resort.
Here you will have light background music that will accompany your breakfast by the pool, your lunch or your dinner.
No blinding lights but soft lighting in all the common areas and in the morning you can enjoy one of the most colorful sunrises I have ever seen.
The pool is perfectly maintained and in the 15 days of my stay we were never more than 3 people.
The lodge offers an excellent economic taxi service .
All the photos from the lodge published correspond to reality.
However, all this has a price.
1) The menu available is 90% Egyptian in which you will surely find what suits you;
2) Only 2 people speak English: Awari and Hamad to whom you should address all your requests. ""ASK AND YOU WILL BE GIVEN"". Change of sheets, cleaning of the room, other towels. Just ask.
3) Google translator in Arabic will be very helpful.
4) The cooking times are a bit long but just order in advance.
In addition, the property hosts people of various nationalities, for free, in exchange for work in the lodge.
All credit cards are accepted as well cash then you do not need to get local Pound.

Would be great to invest in a new coffee machine (and coffee cups) that doesn't break every 5 minutes.

The team of animators was doing a good job both at the beach ( during daytime) and in the bar (at the evening). Food was cooked well, but with limited variety.","Rooms are small, old snd require full refurbishment. In our room we had to ask twice to fix the toilet because it kept breaking down and was not flushing.
Long waiting time to get omelet/fried aggs. No possibility to get something alternative quicker. One needed to wait for boiled ages or pancakes all the same. One needed to come in the beginning of dinner to be able to get good food because by the middle of dinner only leftovers were left"

Cleopatra Luxury Resort Sharm El Sheikh (Resort) (Egypt) Deals,Cleopatra Luxury Resort Sharm El Sheikh,Tijana,Serbia,7 nights · ,December 2024,Couple,Superior Room with Garden View,"Reviewed: December 11, 2024","This was the Honeymoon of our dreams! Everything about the resort was beyond perfect.

The manager Reda especially took really amazing care of us allowing us early check-in and late checkout because our flight got delayed. Anything we needed everyone went out of their way to provide for us.

The food in the Market buffet restaurant is amazing, each day it's different and unique with a great mix of local and international food, there's something there for everyone! Be sure to check out what's grilling on the terrace outside the dining arrea during lunch and dinner because the chefs often make pizza, crepes, bbq... 

As for the drinks, we recommend asking to see what cocktails they offer first because there are a lot of non alcoholic and alcoholic options, and you can modify each and every one! We settled on the mocktail ""Honeymoon"" and just added rum, and we can't recommend that one enough! Special shout out to our boy Mohamed for bringing us our two Honeymoons with rum every time he saw us with empty hands! 🙌☺️

I even had a small medical problem, and the in house medical team was amazing, they took our insurance with no problem so we paid nothing but got excellent amazing service!

We really can't see how anyone can find anything wrong with this paradise, we will come back ASAP! 🩷",No Negative Feedback

It's really nice hotel to spend time for people who are traveling with kids or significant other who wants good service and more toned down hotel. Rooms always where cleaned great and really enjoyed the service from Mahmud and the bartender Ebrahim. Also wanted to say huge thanks to lifeguard who worked at 3th and 7th of February at the pier. On 3th he stopped some russian guy and checked his pockets and found out that he had eggs in his pockets and wanted to feed fishes and maybe even attract sharks, and told him that it's a huge problem and told him to go back... I would say for this cases there should be more serious penalties for such actions (who feed fishes and might attract some dangerous too).
There were some inconveniences with hotel but what is great if you point out the issue - hotel will do their best to fix the issue asap.",Prices at the hotel stores could be bit more reasonable because they are almost 5x more expensive for same product than stores that are just 1km away from hotel.

Sharm Discovery (ig: sharmdiscovey) have a desk there, and they absolutely made our stay!
Muhammed and Aladeen, were there to answer all of our question (you will also find them there in the evening, that is a great moment to relax and plan the next rip!) and shared with us with very important informations that allowed us to plan the perfect excursions for our limited stay.

Very professional, very well informed and prices lower then internet... We will certain come back to use their advice again. Precious! 💎",Swimming pool was unusable: water was way too cold.

One of the receptionists helped us a lot with recommendations of good restaurants and in general he was friendly, and didn't seem to expect tips for his niceness. Unfortunately, I don't remember his name. Breakfast was okay for the B&B room and its price. Maybe for longer stays brekfasts will become boring, it didn't matter to us. Location was good for us. 
A tip: if you book a boat tour (like to Ras Mohamed or Tiran island) and want to sleep longer before a pickup, book in other areas (e.g.: closer to their ports). Our pickup time was twice before 8AM (7:35 & 7:45), while people from other areas were picked up later.","Although a room was quite spacious, a bed was a bit narrow for two.

The food was very good, excellent selection with 2 restaurants to go with the main buffet area. The beach was great, and staff always found us a sunbed, no matter how busy it was. The jetty offers snorkeling, swimming, and diving, with incredible coral and marine life. We did an introductory dive with 'Uncle Ali' from Aqua Fun Diving—it was superb. The staff made us feel completely safe, and their expertise is clear, with a well-deserved reputation. Snorkeling also revealed stunning fish and coral.

I stayed here with my 3-year-old daughter, and I can recommend this hotel for a long winter stay with a child. It’s highly likely that I’ll return next winter for a long stay or visit for a shorter stay during the year. I had tears in my eyes when I left the hotel because I felt at home here and made many new friends.😁All the staff at the hotel are very nice and helpful. However, I would especially like to acknowledge the excellent work and communication skills of Taha Ashraf, Abdel Hamed, Mohamed Helal, and their manager Mr. Mahmoud Hamada, who cleaned my rooms very well and were always very helpful and friendly with me and my daughter.
Pros:
Very good beach, perfect for children.
Good walking opportunities – it’s Naama Bay, close to everything: shops, pharmacies, coffee shops, ATMs, etc.
Good animation – the staff is always busy with something and very good with children.
Child-friendly: the hotel’s grounds are comfortable for using a baby stroller, the beach is very close, and the hotel has a large playground that is open and well-lit 24 hours, which is very popular among children. We met a lot of new friends here.
The hotel also has a small heated swimming pool, great for children in the winter, and a mini water park. Although the mini water park is not heated, I’m sure it’s very popular among children during the rest of the year.
""Arnold SPA"" on the premises. I didn’t try the hammam, but I did take a massage course. They have good therapists and offer reasonable prices for services.","I think some rooms need renovation, especially in Cluster 4. However, I’ve seen that the administration is working on it, and they were willing to help when I wanted to change rooms.
I have some suggestions about the food at the main restaurant (if the administration wants, I can provide some advice in a private message), but overall, I’m satisfied. The staff who clean tables and floors do a good job and clean quickly, which is important to me.
I think it would be nice to have a children’s menu, because if you have a child between 1 and 6 years old who is ""a little picky with food"" like my daughter, it might not be easy to feed them.
I would also advise lowering the volume of the music on the grounds and turning it off for a couple of hours in the afternoon, between 14:00 and 16:00, when people are taking naps. It would also be nice to turn it off a little earlier, around 22:00–22:30.
But anyway, as I mentioned, I am generally satisfied with my stay and would actually like to come back.))"

The rooms and outdoor spaces are kept clean and the landscaping is expansive with two pool areas and a sunset view of the market street. Fresh omelette for breakfast,"The room walls were whitewashed recently, but the fixtures and furniture are old. The sheets were fresh but also old and have some stains. I had two beds in my room so I was able to choose the less stained one. My room didn't have toilet paper or a towel, but the staff provided both when I asked. Breakfast is a strange affair, nothing is labeled on the buffet o you just need to take a chance and try stuff. After filling your plate a staff member brings a cling film wrapped plate with what looks like day old cheese, ham, tomato and cucumber slices to your table. No wifi in the room, but I bought a sim card from Vodafone for 10 euro."

A tip: if you book a boat tour (like to Ras Mohamed or Tiran island) and want to sleep longer before a pickup, book in other areas (e.g.: closer to their ports). Our pickup time was twice before 8AM (7:35 & 7:45), while people from other areas were picked up later.","Although a room was quite spacious, a bed was a bit narrow for two.

Overall, the hotel offers great value for money, and I’d happily return. The evening entertainment had impressive production value, surpassing many other hotels. There were plenty of restaurants to choose from, and the private beach was a great touch.

The staff were exceptionally welcoming and friendly. Special thanks to:
 • Said at the restaurants, who not only corrected a few order mistakes but also anticipated our needs.
 • Mohammed at Velocity Bar, who always got our drinks right with a smile.
 • The bartender at the large pool (sorry, I didn’t catch his name), who made fantastic mojitos and was always cheerful.","Cons:
 • Cold evenings in February – Outdoor seating is available, but blankets would be a great addition.
 • Chaotic restaurant service – While staff were attentive, food orders were frequently incorrect or missing items. Thankfully, Said was often there to help.
 • Persistent activity staff – The poolside animation and activity sellers could be overwhelming. We later learned that asking the lifeguard for a red flag prevents disturbances."

This is the right place to spend a holiday in total serenity, calm and peace in the company of a good book to read.
Here you will not have anyone asking you if you want to have a massage, a tour in the desert, a boat trip. You will not have anyone asking you to go and play water games in the pool and you will not hear disco music at full volume, all typical things of a village-resort.
Here you will have light background music that will accompany your breakfast by the pool, your lunch or your dinner.
No blinding lights but soft lighting in all the common areas and in the morning you can enjoy one of the most colorful sunrises I have ever seen.
The pool is perfectly maintained and in the 15 days of my stay we were never more than 3 people.
The lodge offers an excellent economic taxi service .
All the photos from the lodge published correspond to reality.
However, all this has a price.
1) The menu available is 90% Egyptian in which you will surely find what suits you;
2) Only 2 people speak English: Awari and Hamad to whom you should address all your requests. ""ASK AND YOU WILL BE GIVEN"". Change of sheets, cleaning of the room, other towels. Just ask.
3) Google translator in Arabic will be very helpful.
4) The cooking times are a bit long but just order in advance.
In addition, the property hosts people of various nationalities, for free, in exchange for work in the lodge.
All credit cards are accepted as well cash then you do not need to get local Pound.

The heated pool was not very heated and the entertainment was outside. It was cold at night so we could not join in because we sat inside. The food was good always something nice to eat especially the salad selection. Gala New Year Dinner the food was exceptional and the acts were very good. But it was very cold so did not manage to take my Jacket off. The Gazelle Beach was just 5 min walk from the hotel you cross the road and you are there. Sunbeds and bar to make your day enjoyable.
The hotel could do with an upgrade the TV system is old. (They were installing flat screen TV the day we left so they are trying to upgrade.) The Bathroom and toilet need refurbished bit grubby round the edges, but still ok. I would return to the hotel in the future and i would recommend others to go.
Just some tourist notes for travellers.
Bring English pounds with you because the exchange rate is more money.
The weather was lovely in December but cold at night.
Taxi from the airport was a rip off 1200 Egyptian the taxi drivers gather round you outside and put you under pressure. I would recommend book through your Hotel or use this taxi guy he was amazing and does not rip you off 600 Egypt to and from airport TO NAMMA BAY Joe taxi +20 109 4883377 just leave a message on Wasap and he will translate and get back to you. 
When you arrive at the airport get a local sim card the guy puts it in for you i paid £5 and it lasted me the full 2 weeks.
We went on a tour to Ciro by air to see the Pyramids the trip was organised very well and we had a great time. I will return to Shamel Sheik again in the future.",nothing

"Ghazala Gardens (Resort), Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt) Deals",Ghazala Gardens,Rachel,United Kingdom,7 nights · ,January 2025,Family,Standard Double or Twin Room,"Reviewed: January 4, 2025","Staff were incredible. Could not have been more helpful and attentive to the point where at first I doubted their sincerity but soon realised they are genuinely concerned that you are having the best time. From Yasser in the restaurant who is so kind and for whom nothing odd to much trouble, to Mimi who popped up everywhere just as you needed him, to Ismail who serviced our room so beautifully with his towel art and who constantly kept our building clean and dust free, to the chaps in reception and guest services who were always up for a chat, the whole team really were superb. The reception, restaurants and outside areas are very attractive and picturesque with well maintained gardens and seating areas. The private beach was great with its own restaurant snack lunch included. For a value for money getaway it’s great. Have booked to go back.","All inclusive drinks from the bar lack love… a nice glass, ice, a slice of lemon or lime, or a sprig of basil go a long way. I became a little tired of the repetitive food and how the oil makes everything taste the same, but if you choose wisely, there is decent food to eat. Also the Brazilian restaurant was lovely especially the steak and lobster which you pay extra for but is not expensive and well worth it. Bedrooms were a bit tired… tvs in our two rooms didn’t work but we asked them to be fixed and they did come and do it. Bathrooms were a bit old. Mosquito screens on terrace doors would be a great addition particularly as the aircon is switched off in winter because for them it’s cold, but still feels hot and stuffy for us - sleeping with the window open the first night led to a mosquito frenzy so there wasn’t much option to get cool after that. However I do believe they are gradually updating the rooms so that will help. Free wifi is a little slow and only in lobby but an inexpensive e-sim fixed that problem."

The pools are numerous, and having 3 heated pools, especially the 25M adult pool, is to me a game changer. The cleaning was spotless, and provided fresh beach towels every day.

We were misled in thinking that there were multiple restaurants included but only one is free for all inclusive the rest are extra charge and the food is no better. The one included does have everything you could want though.
Worst thing was the rude / noisy Russians, especially on the main beach, but not much the hotel can do about that.

Overall, the hotel offers great value for money, and I’d happily return. The evening entertainment had impressive production value, surpassing many other hotels. There were plenty of restaurants to choose from, and the private beach was a great touch.

The staff were exceptionally welcoming and friendly. Special thanks to:
 • Said at the restaurants, who not only corrected a few order mistakes but also anticipated our needs.
 • Mohammed at Velocity Bar, who always got our drinks right with a smile.
 • The bartender at the large pool (sorry, I didn’t catch his name), who made fantastic mojitos and was always cheerful.","Cons:
 • Cold evenings in February – Outdoor seating is available, but blankets would be a great addition.
 • Chaotic restaurant service – While staff were attentive, food orders were frequently incorrect or missing items. Thankfully, Said was often there to help.
 • Persistent activity staff – The poolside animation and activity sellers could be overwhelming. We later learned that asking the lifeguard for a red flag prevents disturbances."

Most of the staff was really rude, acted like an all exclusive resort is something that we have to work for. Usually, when we arrive at a resort where all is paid, we dont expect to say no to different offers all the time. Its simply annoying and it ruins the mood. Also, when we went at the beach, only thing we wanted was chill, sun and quiet- what we got was every 20 minutes someone asking us if we want either massage, either souveniours, either a trip, or stretching. An advice to the managers if u really wish to not scare the guests: simply promote thode services as flyers, desks in the lobby and any kind of easy going online information. Cut the hustle, please!

The heated pool was not very heated and the entertainment was outside. It was cold at night so we could not join in because we sat inside. The food was good always something nice to eat especially the salad selection. Gala New Year Dinner the food was exceptional and the acts were very good. But it was very cold so did not manage to take my Jacket off. The Gazelle Beach was just 5 min walk from the hotel you cross the road and you are there. Sunbeds and bar to make your day enjoyable.
The hotel could do with an upgrade the TV system is old. (They were installing flat screen TV the day we left so they are trying to upgrade.) The Bathroom and toilet need refurbished bit grubby round the edges, but still ok. I would return to the hotel in the future and i would recommend others to go.
Just some tourist notes for travellers.
Bring English pounds with you because the exchange rate is more money.
The weather was lovely in December but cold at night.
Taxi from the airport was a rip off 1200 Egyptian the taxi drivers gather round you outside and put you under pressure.

Could not have been more helpful and attentive to the point where at first I doubted their sincerity but soon realised they are genuinely concerned that you are having the best time. From Yasser in the restaurant who is so kind and for whom nothing odd to much trouble, to Mimi who popped up everywhere just as you needed him, to Ismail who serviced our room so beautifully with his towel art and who constantly kept our building clean and dust free, to the chaps in reception and guest services who were always up for a chat, the whole team really were superb. The reception, restaurants and outside areas are very attractive and picturesque with well maintained gardens and seating areas. The private beach was great with its own restaurant snack lunch included. For a value for money getaway it’s great. Have booked to go back.","All inclusive drinks from the bar lack love… a nice glass, ice, a slice of lemon or lime, or a sprig of basil go a long way. I became a little tired of the repetitive food and how the oil makes everything taste the same, but if you choose wisely, there is decent food to eat. Also the Brazilian restaurant was lovely especially the steak and lobster which you pay extra for but is not expensive and well worth it. Bedrooms were a bit tired… tvs in our two rooms didn’t work but we asked them to be fixed and they did come and do it. Bathrooms were a bit old. Mosquito screens on terrace doors would be a great addition particularly as the aircon is switched off in winter because for them it’s cold, but still feels hot and stuffy for us - sleeping with the window open the first night led to a mosquito frenzy so there wasn’t much option to get cool after that. However I do believe they are gradually updating the rooms so that will help. Free wifi is a little slow and only in lobby but an inexpensive e-sim fixed that problem."

The staff were attentive and lovely, but at times were very persistent in trying to sell us day trips (quad biking, snorkelling) that were much cheaper to book with a second party, including arranging taxi services also."

I stayed here with my 3-year-old daughter, and I can recommend this hotel for a long winter stay with a child. It’s highly likely that I’ll return next winter for a long stay or visit for a shorter stay during the year. I had tears in my eyes when I left the hotel because I felt at home here and made many new friends.😁All the staff at the hotel are very nice and helpful. However, I would especially like to acknowledge the excellent work and communication skills of Taha Ashraf, Abdel Hamed, Mohamed Helal, and their manager Mr. Mahmoud Hamada, who cleaned my rooms very well and were always very helpful and friendly with me and my daughter.
Pros:
Very good beach, perfect for children.
Good walking opportunities – it’s Naama Bay, close to everything: shops, pharmacies, coffee shops, ATMs, etc.
Good animation – the staff is always busy with something and very good with children.
Child-friendly: the hotel’s grounds are comfortable for using a baby stroller, the beach is very close, and the hotel has a large playground that is open and well-lit 24 hours, which is very popular among children. We met a lot of new friends here.
The hotel also has a small heated swimming pool, great for children in the winter, and a mini water park. Although the mini water park is not heated, I’m sure it’s very popular among children during the rest of the year.
""Arnold SPA"" on the premises. I didn’t try the hammam, but I did take a massage course. They have good therapists and offer reasonable prices for services.","I think some rooms need renovation, especially in Cluster 4. However, I’ve seen that the administration is working on it, and they were willing to help when I wanted to change rooms.
I have some suggestions about the food at the main restaurant (if the administration wants, I can provide some advice in a private message), but overall, I’m satisfied. The staff who clean tables and floors do a good job and clean quickly, which is important to me.
I think it would be nice to have a children’s menu, because if you have a child between 1 and 6 years old who is ""a little picky with food"" like my daughter, it might not be easy to feed them.
I would also advise lowering the volume of the music on the grounds and turning it off for a couple of hours in the afternoon, between 14:00 and 16:00, when people are taking naps. It would also be nice to turn it off a little earlier, around 22:00–22:30.
But anyway, as I mentioned, I am generally satisfied with my stay and would actually like to come back.))"

The rooms and outdoor spaces are kept clean and the landscaping is expansive with two pool areas and a sunset view of the market street. Fresh omelette for breakfast,"The room walls were whitewashed recently, but the fixtures and furniture are old. The sheets were fresh but also old and have some stains. I had two beds in my room so I was able to choose the less stained one. My room didn't have toilet paper or a towel, but the staff provided both when I asked. Breakfast is a strange affair, nothing is labeled on the buffet o you just need to take a chance and try stuff. After filling your plate a staff member brings a cling film wrapped plate with what looks like day old cheese, ham, tomato and cucumber slices to your table. No wifi in the room, but I bought a sim card from Vodafone for 10 euro."

My stay at Siva Sharm Resort & Spa, though affordable, highlighted several areas for improvement.

Firstly, the state of cleanliness was concerning. Housekeeping was inconsistent and inadequate. Sheets were only changed upon request, and basic amenities like tea and coffee were not replenished. The floors weren't swept; housekeeping simply tidied up, and that was it. Additionally, smoke odors from nearby rooms were bothersome—offering non-smoking rooms could improve this aspect.

Maintenance is also lacking. Many amenities were broken or non-functional, impacting the overall experience.

There was a notable issue with mosquitoes, making it uncomfortable to enjoy outdoor spaces. Effective pest control measures are needed.

Additionally, the pool was not well-maintained and appeared unclean, which was disappointing.

Access to the sea was limited, with only a small area available for use, which may not be suitable for those looking for expansive beach experiences.

The buffet offered limited and repetitive options, lacking variety. Enhancing the meal offerings could significantly boost guest satisfaction.

Overall, while the price is appealing, tackling these issues would greatly improve the experience at Siva Sharm Resort & Spa.

"Regency Plaza Aqua Park and Spa Resort (Resort), Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt) Deals",Regency Plaza Aqua Park and Spa Resort,Berestneva,United Kingdom,5 nights · ,December 2024,Family,Standard Double or Twin Room with Balcony,"Reviewed: December 29, 2024","We arranged a shuttle with the hotel, and upon arrival, they were already waiting for us and assisted with our baggage. Since we arrived quite late, the hotel had prepared a late dinner with drinks for our family, which was a nice touch.

The aqua park operates from 12:00–15:00, as it closes during lunch hours. Since we visited in the winter, the sun sets behind the buildings at 15:30, making the area chilly. However, we still enjoyed the heated pool near the aqua park.

We went snorkeling near the hotel. While there aren't any corals, we saw a variety of fish, including both small and large species. It was a great experience, especially if you've never gone snorkeling before.

The food was good overall. For breakfast, our family had limited options compared to other guests who had a wider selection. Lunch and dinner were consistently tasty, although the menu didn't change much, even on themed days like Italian, fish, or meat days. The desserts were limited but enjoyable.

The hotel has 5 on-site restaurants, with 2 of them being free. These two are divided between the guests, with half going to one and the other half to the second. We were a large group, so we swapped between them, as they wouldn't let us dine together otherwise. For the other 3 restaurants, you need to book based on the number of people in each room; otherwise, they'll cancel your reservation. Since we had 17 people, we booked 3 rooms, and the reception manager was kind enough to arrange different reservations for us, as the other restaurants were fully booked.

On the last day, our daughter got sick, and we called reception. Within 30 minutes, a doctor arrived at our door, provided her with medicine, and gave us prescriptions.

The massage and sauna services on-site were excellent, and the younger teens in our group enjoyed booking several sessions in advance. The girls had their hair styled with colored strings, but by day 5, the strings started coming out.","The taxi service at the hotel was expensive, but we agreed to pay. However, when payment was completed, our group was split, and because one of the cars was damaged, we ended up with our kids on our laps, as the car only had 13 seats for our group of 17. The taxi service had agreed to pick us up around 18:00, but they arrived at 19:30. If the hotel allows outside services, I believe they should ensure they are properly represented.

Another issue was when we were relaxing in the sun, people would walk around trying to sell things. We ended up paying 680 euros for a private cruise to see White Island, which included a buffet and unlimited drinks. However, it turned out to be a simple tourist trip with 20 other passengers. We were really disappointed, as we trusted the hotel and the person from the diving center."

Beautiful beach, with sand and enough sunbeds, a pontoon from which you could snorkel. The room was on the ground floor, with a nice terrace overlooking the garden, spacious enough. Cleanliness was not my strong point, but we survived :). The food was ok, you had plenty to choose from, you weren't starving. A plus for a la carte restaurants (Fish market, Oriental and Italian), you can book from the app for the next day (lunch or dinner). The resort has a very good application, where you can find out a lot of information. Very nice aqua park, both for kids and big kids/adults. It was also very good to have the transport from the airport included in the price, the driver waited for us at the airport exit, even if the plane arrived late at night and was delayed.

There’s also a private rooftop where you can relax, which is a great bonus. Plus, it’s just a short walk to a beautiful coral beach with an entry fee of 150 EGP (around 3 euros—very affordable).","One thing to note: the local mosque’s call to prayer can be quite loud, especially on Fridays.

Overall, the hotel offers great value for money, and I’d happily return. The evening entertainment had impressive production value, surpassing many other hotels. There were plenty of restaurants to choose from, and the private beach was a great touch.

The staff were exceptionally welcoming and friendly. Special thanks to:
 • Said at the restaurants, who not only corrected a few order mistakes but also anticipated our needs.
 • Mohammed at Velocity Bar, who always got our drinks right with a smile.
 • The bartender at the large pool (sorry, I didn’t catch his name), who made fantastic mojitos and was always cheerful.","Cons:
 • Cold evenings in February – Outdoor seating is available, but blankets would be a great addition.
 • Chaotic restaurant service – While staff were attentive, food orders were frequently incorrect or missing items. Thankfully, Said was often there to help.
 • Persistent activity staff – The poolside animation and activity sellers could be overwhelming. We later learned that asking the lifeguard for a red flag prevents disturbances."

This is the right place to spend a holiday in total serenity, calm and peace in the company of a good book to read.
Here you will not have anyone asking you if you want to have a massage, a tour in the desert, a boat trip. You will not have anyone asking you to go and play water games in the pool and you will not hear disco music at full volume, all typical things of a village-resort.
Here you will have light background music that will accompany your breakfast by the pool, your lunch or your dinner.
No blinding lights but soft lighting in all the common areas and in the morning you can enjoy one of the most colorful sunrises I have ever seen.
The pool is perfectly maintained and in the 15 days of my stay we were never more than 3 people.
The lodge offers an excellent economic taxi service .
All the photos from the lodge published correspond to reality.
However, all this has a price.
1) The menu available is 90% Egyptian in which you will surely find what suits you;
2) Only 2 people speak English: Awari and Hamad to whom you should address all your requests. ""ASK AND YOU WILL BE GIVEN"". Change of sheets, cleaning of the room, other towels. Just ask.
3) Google translator in Arabic will be very helpful.
4) The cooking times are a bit long but just order in advance.
In addition, the property hosts people of various nationalities, for free, in exchange for work in the lodge.
All credit cards are accepted as well cash then you do not need to get local Pound.

Most of the staff was really rude, acted like an all exclusive resort is something that we have to work for. Usually, when we arrive at a resort where all is paid, we dont expect to say no to different offers all the time. Its simply annoying and it ruins the mood. Also, when we went at the beach, only thing we wanted was chill, sun and quiet- what we got was every 20 minutes someone asking us if we want either massage, either souveniours, either a trip, or stretching. An advice to the managers if u really wish to not scare the guests: simply promote thode services as flyers, desks in the lobby and any kind of easy going online information. Cut the hustle, please!

Could not have been more helpful and attentive to the point where at first I doubted their sincerity but soon realised they are genuinely concerned that you are having the best time. From Yasser in the restaurant who is so kind and for whom nothing odd to much trouble, to Mimi who popped up everywhere just as you needed him, to Ismail who serviced our room so beautifully with his towel art and who constantly kept our building clean and dust free, to the chaps in reception and guest services who were always up for a chat, the whole team really were superb. The reception, restaurants and outside areas are very attractive and picturesque with well maintained gardens and seating areas. The private beach was great with its own restaurant snack lunch included. For a value for money getaway it’s great. Have booked to go back.","All inclusive drinks from the bar lack love… a nice glass, ice, a slice of lemon or lime, or a sprig of basil go a long way. I became a little tired of the repetitive food and how the oil makes everything taste the same, but if you choose wisely, there is decent food to eat. Also the Brazilian restaurant was lovely especially the steak and lobster which you pay extra for but is not expensive and well worth it. Bedrooms were a bit tired… tvs in our two rooms didn’t work but we asked them to be fixed and they did come and do it. Bathrooms were a bit old. Mosquito screens on terrace doors would be a great addition particularly as the aircon is switched off in winter because for them it’s cold, but still feels hot and stuffy for us - sleeping with the window open the first night led to a mosquito frenzy so there wasn’t much option to get cool after that. However I do believe they are gradually updating the rooms so that will help. Free wifi is a little slow and only in lobby but an inexpensive e-sim fixed that problem."

Very good service from staff.","Although the beach was nice, it was quite small and no opportunity to have a long walk along as it was very enclosed. All inclusive food, especially breakfast was a bit disappointing…..fairly bland, although the deserts were very nice. Not all activities advertised were available and we witnessed an irate man complaining about the lack of snooker cues available on almost every day of our holiday and they still hadn’t been replaced by the time we went home! The hotel is expensive for what you get in my opinion."

The sports bar team, Ziad, were on point, and the lovely lady Maysoon who was always so welcoming around the restaurant. The entire team at this hotel are one of the very best that I have encountered on my travels. The grounds are sensational, so beautifully kept. The beach was wide and sandy, and I liked the touch of wind sheets on the front-line. The walkable pier is very long and lovely for a stroll or weather permitting snorkelling at the end. The pools are numerous, and having 3 heated pools, especially the 25M adult pool, is to me a game changer. The cleaning was spotless, and provided fresh beach towels every day. I really loved the range of food provided especially by the very friendly outside BBQ chefs. I have travelled to Sharm and Hurghada 15 times, and I can honestly say this was the best hotel I have stayed at, and look forward to travelling back again in December.",Nothing really - Perhaps upgrade the sun beds and a few more English channels

My stay at Siva Sharm Resort & Spa, though affordable, highlighted several areas for improvement.

Firstly, the state of cleanliness was concerning. Housekeeping was inconsistent and inadequate. Sheets were only changed upon request, and basic amenities like tea and coffee were not replenished. The floors weren't swept; housekeeping simply tidied up, and that was it. Additionally, smoke odors from nearby rooms were bothersome—offering non-smoking rooms could improve this aspect.

Maintenance is also lacking. Many amenities were broken or non-functional, impacting the overall experience.

There was a notable issue with mosquitoes, making it uncomfortable to enjoy outdoor spaces. Effective pest control measures are needed.

Additionally, the pool was not well-maintained and appeared unclean, which was disappointing.

Access to the sea was limited, with only a small area available for use, which may not be suitable for those looking for expansive beach experiences.

The buffet offered limited and repetitive options, lacking variety. Enhancing the meal offerings could significantly boost guest satisfaction.

Overall, while the price is appealing, tackling these issues would greatly improve the experience at Siva Sharm Resort & Spa.

Overall, the hotel offers great value for money, and I’d happily return. The evening entertainment had impressive production value, surpassing many other hotels. There were plenty of restaurants to choose from, and the private beach was a great touch.

The staff were exceptionally welcoming and friendly. Special thanks to:
 • Said at the restaurants, who not only corrected a few order mistakes but also anticipated our needs.
 • Mohammed at Velocity Bar, who always got our drinks right with a smile.
 • The bartender at the large pool (sorry, I didn’t catch his name), who made fantastic mojitos and was always cheerful.","Cons:
 • Cold evenings in February – Outdoor seating is available, but blankets would be a great addition.
 • Chaotic restaurant service – While staff were attentive, food orders were frequently incorrect or missing items. Thankfully, Said was often there to help.
 • Persistent activity staff – The poolside animation and activity sellers could be overwhelming. We later learned that asking the lifeguard for a red flag prevents disturbances."

"Regency Plaza Aqua Park and Spa Resort (Resort), Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt) Deals",Regency Plaza Aqua Park and Spa Resort,Berestneva,United Kingdom,5 nights · ,December 2024,Family,Standard Double or Twin Room with Balcony,"Reviewed: December 29, 2024","We arranged a shuttle with the hotel, and upon arrival, they were already waiting for us and assisted with our baggage. Since we arrived quite late, the hotel had prepared a late dinner with drinks for our family, which was a nice touch.

The aqua park operates from 12:00–15:00, as it closes during lunch hours. Since we visited in the winter, the sun sets behind the buildings at 15:30, making the area chilly. However, we still enjoyed the heated pool near the aqua park.

We went snorkeling near the hotel. While there aren't any corals, we saw a variety of fish, including both small and large species. It was a great experience, especially if you've never gone snorkeling before.

The food was good overall. For breakfast, our family had limited options compared to other guests who had a wider selection. Lunch and dinner were consistently tasty, although the menu didn't change much, even on themed days like Italian, fish, or meat days. The desserts were limited but enjoyable.

The hotel has 5 on-site restaurants, with 2 of them being free. These two are divided between the guests, with half going to one and the other half to the second. We were a large group, so we swapped between them, as they wouldn't let us dine together otherwise. For the other 3 restaurants, you need to book based on the number of people in each room; otherwise, they'll cancel your reservation. Since we had 17 people, we booked 3 rooms, and the reception manager was kind enough to arrange different reservations for us, as the other restaurants were fully booked.

On the last day, our daughter got sick, and we called reception. Within 30 minutes, a doctor arrived at our door, provided her with medicine, and gave us prescriptions.

The massage and sauna services on-site were excellent, and the younger teens in our group enjoyed booking several sessions in advance. The girls had their hair styled with colored strings, but by day 5, the strings started coming out.","The taxi service at the hotel was expensive, but we agreed to pay. However, when payment was completed, our group was split, and because one of the cars was damaged, we ended up with our kids on our laps, as the car only had 13 seats for our group of 17. The taxi service had agreed to pick us up around 18:00, but they arrived at 19:30. If the hotel allows outside services, I believe they should ensure they are properly represented.

Another issue was when we were relaxing in the sun, people would walk around trying to sell things. We ended up paying 680 euros for a private cruise to see White Island, which included a buffet and unlimited drinks. However, it turned out to be a simple tourist trip with 20 other passengers. We were really disappointed, as we trusted the hotel and the person from the diving center."

Food: if ur a picky eater u may struggle but there was still a variety. Plenty of fish meat rice and salads. There is a couple of snack places too with pizza burgers chips etc
Bars: many areas to get drinks from (didn’t particularly like the spirits but the lager was nice) plenty of soft drinks to choose 
Pools: plenty for kids and adults (we had a swim up pool which was adult only with its own bar) 
Beach: nice area with free loungers and towels included. The sea is shallow to begin with which was nice to have a stroll in and dip ur feet in
Shops in the hotel: had a range of everything but to the right of the resort a 5 minute walk is a bigger complex with shops and a couple of bars/eateries
Wi-Fi: free around the complex had no problems",Massive complex so a lot of walking to get to different restaurants and pools which isn’t a bad thing unless you have mobility issues

Beautiful beach, with sand and enough sunbeds, a pontoon from which you could snorkel. The room was on the ground floor, with a nice terrace overlooking the garden, spacious enough. Cleanliness was not my strong point, but we survived :). The food was ok, you had plenty to choose from, you weren't starving. A plus for a la carte restaurants (Fish market, Oriental and Italian), you can book from the app for the next day (lunch or dinner). The resort has a very good application, where you can find out a lot of information. Very nice aqua park, both for kids and big kids/adults. It was also very good to have the transport from the airport included in the price, the driver waited for us at the airport exit, even if the plane arrived late at night and was delayed. You must go to see at least one sunrise on the beach. We think it was a good choice, we recommend it to the unpretentious. We would return.",No Negative Feedback

"Abouseif Guest House (Apartment), Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt) Deals",Abouseif Guest House,Miranda,Germany,2 nights · ,December 2024,Solo traveler,One-Bedroom Apartment - Oceanfront,"Reviewed: January 7, 2025","Apartment - cute, modern and cosy apartment with an attic bedroom, balcony facing the sea, comfortable bed.

Location - the absolute highlight! The house is located in a quiet, upscale neighbourhood just 5 minutes walk from a gas station and shopping mall and apparently a local bus. The back of the apartment opens out onto a private section of the coast! Turn left and walk 3 minutes or so and you can head down the cliff stairs to your own private beach. The only place I felt comfortable at the beach my whole time in Egypt. 
 The famous Farsha cafe is only a 15 minute walk away, along with the famous reefs for snorkelling. However, after having snorkelled at both the reefs in front of Farsha and at this private beach, it's the same if not better here! Plus you don't have to pay 150EGP entry and deal with the blasting music and tourist crowds of the beach at Farsha - nightmare.
The private beach is clean, secluded, never crowded and very serene. It is rocky so bring your water shoes. I wish I had booked more days just to stay at this beach.

Price - very decent price for Sharm El Sheikh.","Communication - there was no communication from them before I arrived, even when I messaged them informing what time I'd be arriving. Lo and behold, when I arrived not only was it not clear which building it was but there was no one around. So I had to just stand around waiting with my luggage. I managed to get through to them via phone and they sent the housekeeper, who I couldn't communicate with, to collect me. Once I was checked in, since I could not communicate with the housekeeper, I had to message them to ask about things, such as how/where is the beach, how do i get down etc. I wasted a lot of precious time wandering around trying to work out how to get down to the private beach (the housekeeper told me to go right which led to no where I could get down...) Guests shouldn't have to be chasing for basic information.

Bathroom - the shower corner is so tiny that when you shower the curtain basically touches and sticks to you. Try and shower without the curtain and the whole room is flooded.

Bedroom - Though the bed was comfortable, I was bitten by mosquitos all night and it wasn't even that warm. I don't know what it would be like at the height of summer. 

Kitchen - nice big and modern fridge but the 2 hob plug in electric cooker takes ages to heat up and is very weak and there are no cupboards so therefore a lack of basic cooking material. No chopping board, adequate cutlery, proper plates and bowls etc."

You go out for dive or other activities, come back there and you can just take s breathe, relax, recover and get ready for another day 👍.

The staff were very kind and the hostel dorm itself is situated off the back side of Delta Sharm resort area, near the pool with the strange rock formation with a Cafe run by Sabine who offers an affordable breakfast. Beds were new and very comfortable (Dec2024). The blackout curtain, when used properly, also works extremely well and the terrace has a screen and sliding glass door. Use inDrive in Sharm to get to/from the airport if you're able to connect your Egyptian number, or, use their taxi service for ~$10 to save yourself the haggling. Kettle to boil water and a kitchen to cook in, although not sure what was available for cutlery or utensils. Definitely the best value for your money in Sharm..possibly the only hostel here? Great pool available nearby and a short walk or 5LE shared bus from the main road into town.","No outlets by individual beds and I was in a bed where the AC blew directly on me. Luckily I was here in December and we didn't need it much, but I can imagine the choice between sweating like crazy or freezing yourself isn't a pleasant one in the summer. Maybe a rearrangement of the bunks could help. I would have also appreciated a clearer posting of quiet hours as guests awoke at odd hours of the night to boil the kettle in the kitchen, have loud phone conversations and turned on bright overhead lights. I know, I know, it's a hostel, but there *should be* some understood common courtesy, which seems to be lacking in a lot of Egyptian hostels. 

Other random points: Nowhere to store bags securely, there were small drawers under beds but they didn't fit a standard suitcase or backpack, and the sliding door was left open and unlocked throughout the day...but you're on a resort it should be fine. No towels available. It's pretty obvious this was just another apartment on the resort property which they've converted into a (mixed, aka shared between all genders) hostel dorm. Not much for atmosphere or socializing."

Most of the staff was really rude, acted like an all exclusive resort is something that we have to work for. Usually, when we arrive at a resort where all is paid, we dont expect to say no to different offers all the time. Its simply annoying and it ruins the mood. Also, when we went at the beach, only thing we wanted was chill, sun and quiet- what we got was every 20 minutes someone asking us if we want either massage, either souveniours, either a trip, or stretching. An advice to the managers if u really wish to not scare the guests: simply promote thode services as flyers, desks in the lobby and any kind of easy going online information. Cut the hustle, please!

The flat is well equipped including a washing machine, microwave, oven, ironing board and iron, settees, dining table, a huge wardrobe, comfortable bed and a balcony (for drying your wet suits, etc). Really I can honestly say hand on heart we were not missing anything during our over two week stay in Hany’s flat - it felt like home from the get go! I felt very safe in the neighbourhood – there is good lighting on the street where the flat’s located; the neighbours in the building are considerate and the whole place is very quiet for a busy resort like Sharm. There is just so much to do within easy reach of Hany‘s place that I can honestly say I could well have stayed for another two weeks and still would not have run out of activities to do or places to visit or things to see! If I was to return to Sharm I for sure am going to come back to this flat and not only that but I am going to recommend Hany’s place to all my friends and relatives, even if they are not considering a trip to Egypt they should with such a hospitable host! ❤",No Negative Feedback

It has beach access but it’s rather small and gets full. They brought fruit and drinks to our room which was nice.,"Interactions with staff have been okay until our encounter with a rude staff member at snack area. Around 5 pm, 10/27 we got our snacks and tried to sit in one of the tables in the back. One staff got in our face & started blabbering something, we couldn’t understand what he was saying. I guess he didn’t want us sitting there. Then as we were walking away, he made a comment in Arabic, “You didn’t understand sh*t I just said.” He didn’t know that one of us is Egyptian & speaks Arabic. As a struggling hotel business, you probably shouldn’t have anyone on staff that is this hostile and DISRESPECTFUL to guests. Maybe have staff learn English since there are more than just russians coming to Egypt. 

Most of the dinner buffet food was a bit bland, except for the fish which was way too salty. We had what looked like basbousa for dessert & it tasted like saw dust. The rest of the desserts the same. Maybe they wanted to save money on sugar? The juice had a bizarre taste, it was like drinking windex. Perhaps this is the preferred taste of their usual clientele. 

Animation very loud at 10-11 pm. Not good if you’re trying to sleep at this time."

The heated pool was not very heated and the entertainment was outside. It was cold at night so we could not join in because we sat inside.

But it was very cold so did not manage to take my Jacket off. The Gazelle Beach was just 5 min walk from the hotel you cross the road and you are there. Sunbeds and bar to make your day enjoyable.
The hotel could do with an upgrade the TV system is old. (They were installing flat screen TV the day we left so they are trying to upgrade.) The Bathroom and toilet need refurbished bit grubby round the edges, but still ok. I would return to the hotel in the future and i would recommend others to go.
Just some tourist notes for travellers.
Bring English pounds with you because the exchange rate is more money.
The weather was lovely in December but cold at night.
Taxi from the airport was a rip off 1200 Egyptian the taxi drivers gather round you outside and put you under pressure. I would recommend book through your Hotel or use this taxi guy he was amazing and does not rip you off 600 Egypt to and from airport TO NAMMA BAY Joe taxi +20 109 4883377 just leave a message on Wasap and he will translate and get back to you. 
When you arrive at the airport get a local sim card the guy puts it in for you i paid £5 and it lasted me the full 2 weeks.

Could not have been more helpful and attentive to the point where at first I doubted their sincerity but soon realised they are genuinely concerned that you are having the best time. From Yasser in the restaurant who is so kind and for whom nothing odd to much trouble, to Mimi who popped up everywhere just as you needed him, to Ismail who serviced our room so beautifully with his towel art and who constantly kept our building clean and dust free, to the chaps in reception and guest services who were always up for a chat, the whole team really were superb. The reception, restaurants and outside areas are very attractive and picturesque with well maintained gardens and seating areas. The private beach was great with its own restaurant snack lunch included. For a value for money getaway it’s great. Have booked to go back.","All inclusive drinks from the bar lack love… a nice glass, ice, a slice of lemon or lime, or a sprig of basil go a long way. I became a little tired of the repetitive food and how the oil makes everything taste the same, but if you choose wisely, there is decent food to eat. Also the Brazilian restaurant was lovely especially the steak and lobster which you pay extra for but is not expensive and well worth it. Bedrooms were a bit tired… tvs in our two rooms didn’t work but we asked them to be fixed and they did come and do it. Bathrooms were a bit old. Mosquito screens on terrace doors would be a great addition particularly as the aircon is switched off in winter because for them it’s cold, but still feels hot and stuffy for us - sleeping with the window open the first night led to a mosquito frenzy so there wasn’t much option to get cool after that. However I do believe they are gradually updating the rooms so that will help. Free wifi is a little slow and only in lobby but an inexpensive e-sim fixed that problem."

Not only is there a great view of the Nile on the marvelous sun deck/rooftop, the staff is SO GREAT!!!! Really!! You'll never believe this story (I barely believe it myself still!) but, flying from Cairo to Aswan, my luggage was delayed/lost, and I had to go on a cruise ship the next morning. First of all, I'd booked a pickup with Aswan Nile Palace, but me (and the other five passengers who also lost their luggage) had to spend an hour and a half filling out forms in the airport...but the driver was STILL WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE!!! Almost two hours later! Fantastic! The next morning, as I was waiting outside the hotel for the van to pick me up, HARES (the owner) happened to be there, and asked me how I enjoyed my stay. I told him I LOVED the extra hot water in the shower (difficult to find sometimes) and, especially--the fluffy towels!!! Really, they were like towels you'd find in a luxury hotel!! Shocking for a hostel! And then I was telling him about my luggage being lost and...he said...wait a minute! I know a guy who works in the lost luggage department at Aswan Airport (!!!!!!!) So he got the guy on the phone, who checked his computer, who found my luggage in Cairo, and told me it would be (exactly) on a flight that arrived in Aswan at 3:30 PM, and that they would deliver it for the cruise ship by 5:30 PM. And it all actually happened!!!!!! Not only that, the guy from lost luggage actually sent me a photo of my bag when it arrived at the Aswan airport! Really, it was SO GREAT knowing that early the next day that I would actually have luggage and not have to scrabble around trying to buy shirts, socks and underwear! What are the chances of all this happening??!! And also...I think something like this in the US would never happen! Minas, and the staff of the Aswan Nile Palace REALLY CARE about their guests!!!!

"Labib Guest House (Guesthouse), Aswan (Egypt) Deals",Labib Guest House,Traveller,Egypt,1 night · ,January 2025,Couple,Deluxe Double or Twin Room,"Reviewed: January 20, 2025","Absolutely outstanding!
This is a multi-storey house on Elephantine Island, Nubian style, where the host - Hamada and his family - live on the ground floor. There are multiple rooms for guests throughout the building.
Breakfast is provided on the rooftop each morning, and there are views of the Aga Khan III Mausoleom directly opposite, as well as lovely views of the sand cliffs that lift up from the Nile.
It's peaceful, it's beautiful, and it's away from the hustle and bustle of the Aswan side of the island.
Hamada and his family are lovely!
Hamada himself contacted me to arrange pickup from the ferry wharf even before we arrived, and transported us and our luggage to his home.
During our stay, he helped us arrange transport to the wharf to get to Philae Temple, took us to Kitchener Island and the nearby dock for Tombs Of The Nobles on his motorboat, and made sure we got to the train station on time.
The rooms are cosy, with comfortable beds and a clean bathroom.
The public ferry is 15 minutes walk from the guesthouse (it operates 6am - 12 midnight every day), and the island itself is fun to explore with multiple convenience stores and restaurants.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Labib House!",Really no complaints

The triple room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable. The views from the east-facing balcony were gorgeous at sunrise. The room had a great AC, a fridge (a pleasant surprise that should be listed in the room facilities!), and nice toiletries. The bathroom hairdryer was much appreciated.

The Egyptian breakfast was excellent. We enjoyed it in the restaurant one day and had it packed for an early tour on another day. The takeaway breakfast box contained an egg, jam, Egyptian bread, soft cheese, juice, and banana. We had a douwd pasha for dinner which was delicious, made with local items.

Both Ahmeds and all other staff members were extremely helpful and friendly.","Not negatives but things to note/areas for improvement:
- The bathroom follows traditional Nubian style without a separated shower area. You'll need to sweep water toward the drain, though the bathroom is well-ventilated. 
- Some lamps would make the room more ambient (there were a couple of dim lights in the room, but they weren't strong enough for reading).

WiFi is unreliable and only works in the lobby. Breakfast is adequate and repetitive, with the same options daily.
River view is amazing!!!!","Staff members attempt to sell trips as soon as you enter, pressuring you about excursions. Once they realise you won't purchase any tours, they stop paying attention to you. When I extended my stay, despite booking a higher category room, they tried to give me to a lower standard room. Be cautious and watch your back. Overall, worth much less than 70 usd per night"

The hotel grounds are pretty, give you the summer island holiday feel with lovely Nubian art and decoration.
The Jacuzzi is big enough to fit 3 people comfortably. 
Service was very efficient, we requested boats to go to Philae Temple twice and both times the boats were prepared on time or earlier than requested. 
The shuttle boat that brings you to Aswan is free of charge and 24h available.
We went to Abu Simbel one day and left around 4am, the hotel gave us breakfast boxes, the boxes were huge with a lot of sandwiches, fruits, baked goods, water, juice - so much that actually a box would suffice for 2 people instead of one.
The location of the hotel is nice because it is secluded so it is therefore very peaceful, you’re in the middle of the nile with nice views to enjoy. Since are not really interested in the city of Aswan itself and were only there to visit Philae and Abu Simbel - both of which are quite far away anyway - the location was perfect for us because we did not need the city center, so this is a point to keep in mind.","I wouldn’t say I didnt like anything, but the location is something to keep in mind depending on your preference and why you’re visiting Aswan (see my comment on location under things i liked)"

Staff first class. Cleanliness first class. Menu not 5 star but who's counting when everything else is so good. The hotel is very reasonably priced and although it's new and there are a few minor snags, like the hair drier not working and still a bit of tidying up to be done around the hotel: I have absolutely no problem in recommending this hotel with magnificent views up and down the Nile. Not sure but there may be a few of the rooms that do not face onto the Nile. If a room with a view isn't your thing then that's OK. The open air dining area is on the roof and we did wear a jumper at times when the breeze was high either in the morning or evening but in early January this isn't unexpected.

Hostel is in the Aswan souk - if arriving at the railway station, turn left to enter the souk (pedestrian-only so no traffic to dodge or taxi drivers harassing you) and walk until you get to the T-junction. The entrance is diagonally left, a hidden alleyway between 2 clothing stores (circled in yellow). I stayed on the 4th floor, which was 2 dorm rooms and a third bedroom, with one shared bathroom. The lack of traffic was quite peaceful, the noise from the souk never bothered the girls dorm. You can rent towels and locks for the locker. Bunkbed has a privacy curtain, electrical outlet, and lamp. Form mattress and SOLID pillow. There’s a kitchen on the 5th floor. Biba arranged for a small group tour to Abu Simbel, the pickup point was a short walk from the hostel. Property was very clean, and I would definitely recommend it, I loved the location, the staff, and the peaceful nights sleep I got.","Others have commented on the 4 flights of stairs you have to walk up, and with your luggage they really are no joke. I recommend traveling light. Also, if the boys dorm is populated by slobs then the shared bathroom will probably get dire, but there’s cleaning supplies in the bathroom and MULTIPLE signs please asking guests to not be pigs so that’s on us guests, really"

The location is on the 3rd or 4th floor. So be prepare for the luggages. I herd, throug the grape vines, that an elevator is to be installed in the near future.

Upon arrival, you can tell right away that you will have a wonderful stay. Hosts are very welcoming, and the facility is well maintained. Tidy and comfortable.

Room #3 is facing the pedestrian street (souk), and you will hear noise coming from there. But, it's nothing to compare with Cairo (which is a good thing). So, bring your earplugs if you are a light sleeper (like me). I am convinced that this issue could be easily resolved with a creative solution toward the window.

Guests are respectful.

Hosts are sensible and attentive to your comfort and happiness.

Not only is there a great view of the Nile on the marvelous sun deck/rooftop, the staff is SO GREAT!!!! Really!! You'll never believe this story (I barely believe it myself still!) but, flying from Cairo to Aswan, my luggage was delayed/lost, and I had to go on a cruise ship the next morning. First of all, I'd booked a pickup with Aswan Nile Palace, but me (and the other five passengers who also lost their luggage) had to spend an hour and a half filling out forms in the airport...but the driver was STILL WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE!!! Almost two hours later! Fantastic! The next morning, as I was waiting outside the hotel for the van to pick me up, HARES (the owner) happened to be there, and asked me how I enjoyed my stay. I told him I LOVED the extra hot water in the shower (difficult to find sometimes) and, especially--the fluffy towels!!! Really, they were like towels you'd find in a luxury hotel!! Shocking for a hostel! And then I was telling him about my luggage being lost and...he said...wait a minute! I know a guy who works in the lost luggage department at Aswan Airport (!!!!!!!) So he got the guy on the phone, who checked his computer, who found my luggage in Cairo, and told me it would be (exactly) on a flight that arrived in Aswan at 3:30 PM, and that they would deliver it for the cruise ship by 5:30 PM. And it all actually happened!!!!!! Not only that, the guy from lost luggage actually sent me a photo of my bag when it arrived at the Aswan airport! Really, it was SO GREAT knowing that early the next day that I would actually have luggage and not have to scrabble around trying to buy shirts, socks and underwear! What are the chances of all this happening??!! And also...I think something like this in the US would never happen! Minas, and the staff of the Aswan Nile Palace REALLY CARE about their guests!!!!

This is a multi-storey house on Elephantine Island, Nubian style, where the host - Hamada and his family - live on the ground floor. There are multiple rooms for guests throughout the building.
Breakfast is provided on the rooftop each morning, and there are views of the Aga Khan III Mausoleom directly opposite, as well as lovely views of the sand cliffs that lift up from the Nile.
It's peaceful, it's beautiful, and it's away from the hustle and bustle of the Aswan side of the island.
Hamada and his family are lovely!
Hamada himself contacted me to arrange pickup from the ferry wharf even before we arrived, and transported us and our luggage to his home.
During our stay, he helped us arrange transport to the wharf to get to Philae Temple, took us to Kitchener Island and the nearby dock for Tombs Of The Nobles on his motorboat, and made sure we got to the train station on time.
The rooms are cosy, with comfortable beds and a clean bathroom.
The public ferry is 15 minutes walk from the guesthouse (it operates 6am - 12 midnight every day), and the island itself is fun to explore with multiple convenience stores and restaurants.

The hotel's own boat service for check-in and check-out was very convenient. The private dock was useful for our pre-booked Felucca sailing trip, which picked us up directly from the guesthouse. 

The triple room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable. The views from the east-facing balcony were gorgeous at sunrise. The room had a great AC, a fridge (a pleasant surprise that should be listed in the room facilities!), and nice toiletries. The bathroom hairdryer was much appreciated.

The Egyptian breakfast was excellent. We enjoyed it in the restaurant one day and had it packed for an early tour on another day. The takeaway breakfast box contained an egg, jam, Egyptian bread, soft cheese, juice, and banana. We had a douwd pasha for dinner which was delicious, made with local items.

Both Ahmeds and all other staff members were extremely helpful and friendly.","Not negatives but things to note/areas for improvement:
- The bathroom follows traditional Nubian style without a separated shower area. You'll need to sweep water toward the drain, though the bathroom is well-ventilated. 
- Some lamps would make the room more ambient (there were a couple of dim lights in the room, but they weren't strong enough for reading). 
- Early dinner orders are recommended as kitchen preparation times can be lengthy. Last orders are taken by 9:45pm."

The hotel grounds are pretty, give you the summer island holiday feel with lovely Nubian art and decoration.
The Jacuzzi is big enough to fit 3 people comfortably. 
Service was very efficient, we requested boats to go to Philae Temple twice and both times the boats were prepared on time or earlier than requested. 
The shuttle boat that brings you to Aswan is free of charge and 24h available.
We went to Abu Simbel one day and left around 4am, the hotel gave us breakfast boxes, the boxes were huge with a lot of sandwiches, fruits, baked goods, water, juice - so much that actually a box would suffice for 2 people instead of one.
The location of the hotel is nice because it is secluded so it is therefore very peaceful, you’re in the middle of the nile with nice views to enjoy. Since are not really interested in the city of Aswan itself and were only there to visit Philae and Abu Simbel - both of which are quite far away anyway - the location was perfect for us because we did not need the city center, so this is a point to keep in mind.","I wouldn’t say I didnt like anything, but the location is something to keep in mind depending on your preference and why you’re visiting Aswan (see my comment on location under things i liked)"

Hostel is in the Aswan souk - if arriving at the railway station, turn left to enter the souk (pedestrian-only so no traffic to dodge or taxi drivers harassing you) and walk until you get to the T-junction. The entrance is diagonally left, a hidden alleyway between 2 clothing stores (circled in yellow). I stayed on the 4th floor, which was 2 dorm rooms and a third bedroom, with one shared bathroom. The lack of traffic was quite peaceful, the noise from the souk never bothered the girls dorm. You can rent towels and locks for the locker. Bunkbed has a privacy curtain, electrical outlet, and lamp. Form mattress and SOLID pillow. There’s a kitchen on the 5th floor. Biba arranged for a small group tour to Abu Simbel, the pickup point was a short walk from the hostel. Property was very clean, and I would definitely recommend it, I loved the location, the staff, and the peaceful nights sleep I got.","Others have commented on the 4 flights of stairs you have to walk up, and with your luggage they really are no joke. I recommend traveling light. Also, if the boys dorm is populated by slobs then the shared bathroom will probably get dire, but there’s cleaning supplies in the bathroom and MULTIPLE signs please asking guests to not be pigs so that’s on us guests, really"

The location is on the 3rd or 4th floor. So be prepare for the luggages. I herd, throug the grape vines, that an elevator is to be installed in the near future.

Upon arrival, you can tell right away that you will have a wonderful stay. Hosts are very welcoming, and the facility is well maintained. Tidy and comfortable.

Room #3 is facing the pedestrian street (souk), and you will hear noise coming from there. But, it's nothing to compare with Cairo (which is a good thing). So, bring your earplugs if you are a light sleeper (like me). I am convinced that this issue could be easily resolved with a creative solution toward the window.

Guests are respectful.

Hosts are sensible and attentive to your comfort and happiness.

I stayed at two different hostels during my stay, and Wanees hostel was my favorite.

You'll never believe this story (I barely believe it myself still!) but, flying from Cairo to Aswan, my luggage was delayed/lost, and I had to go on a cruise ship the next morning. First of all, I'd booked a pickup with Aswan Nile Palace, but me (and the other five passengers who also lost their luggage) had to spend an hour and a half filling out forms in the airport...but the driver was STILL WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE!!! Almost two hours later! Fantastic! The next morning, as I was waiting outside the hotel for the van to pick me up, HARES (the owner) happened to be there, and asked me how I enjoyed my stay. I told him I LOVED the extra hot water in the shower (difficult to find sometimes) and, especially--the fluffy towels!!! Really, they were like towels you'd find in a luxury hotel!! Shocking for a hostel! And then I was telling him about my luggage being lost and...he said...wait a minute! I know a guy who works in the lost luggage department at Aswan Airport (!!!!!!!) So he got the guy on the phone, who checked his computer, who found my luggage in Cairo, and told me it would be (exactly) on a flight that arrived in Aswan at 3:30 PM, and that they would deliver it for the cruise ship by 5:30 PM. And it all actually happened!!!!!! Not only that, the guy from lost luggage actually sent me a photo of my bag when it arrived at the Aswan airport! Really, it was SO GREAT knowing that early the next day that I would actually have luggage and not have to scrabble around trying to buy shirts, socks and underwear! What are the chances of all this happening??!! And also...I think something like this in the US would never happen! Minas, and the staff of the Aswan Nile Palace REALLY CARE about their guests!!!! ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!",No Negative Feedback

This is a multi-storey house on Elephantine Island, Nubian style, where the host - Hamada and his family - live on the ground floor. There are multiple rooms for guests throughout the building.
Breakfast is provided on the rooftop each morning, and there are views of the Aga Khan III Mausoleom directly opposite, as well as lovely views of the sand cliffs that lift up from the Nile.
It's peaceful, it's beautiful, and it's away from the hustle and bustle of the Aswan side of the island.
Hamada and his family are lovely!
Hamada himself contacted me to arrange pickup from the ferry wharf even before we arrived, and transported us and our luggage to his home.
During our stay, he helped us arrange transport to the wharf to get to Philae Temple, took us to Kitchener Island and the nearby dock for Tombs Of The Nobles on his motorboat, and made sure we got to the train station on time.
The rooms are cosy, with comfortable beds and a clean bathroom.

The property provides free boat transportation to and from the hotel on the island for check in and check out. They also can arrange transportation for trips for sightseeing. The drivers will wait while you do your sightseeing and bring you back to the boat for the transportation back to the hotel. The car and the boat owned by the company that owns the hotel and the drivers are employees of that company.,There are heavy doors and people were banging them loudly. There was a party in the cafe that got very loud at night with people singing as well as talking loudly.. The cafe is supposed to close at 11 pm but the continued to 11:30. We wanted to go to bed early because we wanted to get an early start the next morning. That didn’t happen.

"Kana Kato (Guesthouse), Aswan (Egypt) Deals",Kana Kato,Sara,United Kingdom,2 nights · ,January 2025,Couple,Superior Triple Room with Sea View,"Reviewed: January 28, 2025","The guesthouse is conveniently between both ferry points of the island, with its own boat dock. The hotel's own boat service for check-in and check-out was very convenient. The private dock was useful for our pre-booked Felucca sailing trip, which picked us up directly from the guesthouse. 

The triple room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable. The views from the east-facing balcony were gorgeous at sunrise. The room had a great AC, a fridge (a pleasant surprise that should be listed in the room facilities!), and nice toiletries. The bathroom hairdryer was much appreciated.

The Egyptian breakfast was excellent. We enjoyed it in the restaurant one day and had it packed for an early tour on another day. The takeaway breakfast box contained an egg, jam, Egyptian bread, soft cheese, juice, and banana. We had a douwd pasha for dinner which was delicious, made with local items.

Both Ahmeds and all other staff members were extremely helpful and friendly.","Not negatives but things to note/areas for improvement:
- The bathroom follows traditional Nubian style without a separated shower area. You'll need to sweep water toward the drain, though the bathroom is well-ventilated. 
- Some lamps would make the room more ambient (there were a couple of dim lights in the room, but they weren't strong enough for reading). 
- Early dinner orders are recommended as kitchen preparation times can be lengthy. Last orders are taken by 9:45pm."

The hotel grounds are pretty, give you the summer island holiday feel with lovely Nubian art and decoration.
The Jacuzzi is big enough to fit 3 people comfortably. 
Service was very efficient, we requested boats to go to Philae Temple twice and both times the boats were prepared on time or earlier than requested. 
The shuttle boat that brings you to Aswan is free of charge and 24h available.
We went to Abu Simbel one day and left around 4am, the hotel gave us breakfast boxes, the boxes were huge with a lot of sandwiches, fruits, baked goods, water, juice - so much that actually a box would suffice for 2 people instead of one.
The location of the hotel is nice because it is secluded so it is therefore very peaceful, you’re in the middle of the nile with nice views to enjoy. Since are not really interested in the city of Aswan itself and were only there to visit Philae and Abu Simbel - both of which are quite far away anyway - the location was perfect for us because we did not need the city center, so this is a point to keep in mind.","I wouldn’t say I didnt like anything, but the location is something to keep in mind depending on your preference and why you’re visiting Aswan (see my comment on location under things i liked)"

Staff first class. Cleanliness first class. Menu not 5 star but who's counting when everything else is so good. The hotel is very reasonably priced and although it's new and there are a few minor snags, like the hair drier not working and still a bit of tidying up to be done around the hotel: I have absolutely no problem in recommending this hotel with magnificent views up and down the Nile. Not sure but there may be a few of the rooms that do not face onto the Nile. If a room with a view isn't your thing then that's OK. The open air dining area is on the roof and we did wear a jumper at times when the breeze was high either in the morning or evening but in early January this isn't unexpected.

Hostel is in the Aswan souk - if arriving at the railway station, turn left to enter the souk (pedestrian-only so no traffic to dodge or taxi drivers harassing you) and walk until you get to the T-junction. The entrance is diagonally left, a hidden alleyway between 2 clothing stores (circled in yellow). I stayed on the 4th floor, which was 2 dorm rooms and a third bedroom, with one shared bathroom. The lack of traffic was quite peaceful, the noise from the souk never bothered the girls dorm. You can rent towels and locks for the locker. Bunkbed has a privacy curtain, electrical outlet, and lamp. Form mattress and SOLID pillow. There’s a kitchen on the 5th floor. Biba arranged for a small group tour to Abu Simbel, the pickup point was a short walk from the hostel. Property was very clean, and I would definitely recommend it, I loved the location, the staff, and the peaceful nights sleep I got.","Others have commented on the 4 flights of stairs you have to walk up, and with your luggage they really are no joke. I recommend traveling light. Also, if the boys dorm is populated by slobs then the shared bathroom will probably get dire, but there’s cleaning supplies in the bathroom and MULTIPLE signs please asking guests to not be pigs so that’s on us guests, really"

The location is on the 3rd or 4th floor. So be prepare for the luggages. I herd, throug the grape vines, that an elevator is to be installed in the near future.

Upon arrival, you can tell right away that you will have a wonderful stay. Hosts are very welcoming, and the facility is well maintained. Tidy and comfortable.

Room #3 is facing the pedestrian street (souk), and you will hear noise coming from there. But, it's nothing to compare with Cairo (which is a good thing). So, bring your earplugs if you are a light sleeper (like me). I am convinced that this issue could be easily resolved with a creative solution toward the window.

Guests are respectful.

Hosts are sensible and attentive to your comfort and happiness.

This is a multi-storey house on Elephantine Island, Nubian style, where the host - Hamada and his family - live on the ground floor. There are multiple rooms for guests throughout the building.
Breakfast is provided on the rooftop each morning, and there are views of the Aga Khan III Mausoleom directly opposite, as well as lovely views of the sand cliffs that lift up from the Nile.
It's peaceful, it's beautiful, and it's away from the hustle and bustle of the Aswan side of the island.
Hamada and his family are lovely!
Hamada himself contacted me to arrange pickup from the ferry wharf even before we arrived, and transported us and our luggage to his home.
During our stay, he helped us arrange transport to the wharf to get to Philae Temple, took us to Kitchener Island and the nearby dock for Tombs Of The Nobles on his motorboat, and made sure we got to the train station on time.
The rooms are cosy, with comfortable beds and a clean bathroom.
The public ferry is 15 minutes walk from the guesthouse (it operates 6am - 12 midnight every day), and the island itself is fun to explore with multiple convenience stores and restaurants.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Labib House!",Really no complaints

First of all, I'd booked a pickup with Aswan Nile Palace, but me (and the other five passengers who also lost their luggage) had to spend an hour and a half filling out forms in the airport...but the driver was STILL WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE!!! Almost two hours later! Fantastic! The next morning, as I was waiting outside the hotel for the van to pick me up, HARES (the owner) happened to be there, and asked me how I enjoyed my stay. I told him I LOVED the extra hot water in the shower (difficult to find sometimes) and, especially--the fluffy towels!!! Really, they were like towels you'd find in a luxury hotel!! Shocking for a hostel! And then I was telling him about my luggage being lost and...he said...wait a minute! I know a guy who works in the lost luggage department at Aswan Airport (!!!!!!!) So he got the guy on the phone, who checked his computer, who found my luggage in Cairo, and told me it would be (exactly) on a flight that arrived in Aswan at 3:30 PM, and that they would deliver it for the cruise ship by 5:30 PM. And it all actually happened!!!!!! Not only that, the guy from lost luggage actually sent me a photo of my bag when it arrived at the Aswan airport! Really, it was SO GREAT knowing that early the next day that I would actually have luggage and not have to scrabble around trying to buy shirts, socks and underwear!

The property provides free boat transportation to and from the hotel on the island for check in and check out. They also can arrange transportation for trips for sightseeing. The drivers will wait while you do your sightseeing and bring you back to the boat for the transportation back to the hotel. The car and the boat owned by the company that owns the hotel and the drivers are employees of that company.,There are heavy doors and people were banging them loudly. There was a party in the cafe that got very loud at night with people singing as well as talking loudly.. The cafe is supposed to close at 11 pm but the continued to 11:30.

The hotel's own boat service for check-in and check-out was very convenient. The private dock was useful for our pre-booked Felucca sailing trip, which picked us up directly from the guesthouse. 

The triple room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable. The views from the east-facing balcony were gorgeous at sunrise. The room had a great AC, a fridge (a pleasant surprise that should be listed in the room facilities!), and nice toiletries. The bathroom hairdryer was much appreciated.

The Egyptian breakfast was excellent. We enjoyed it in the restaurant one day and had it packed for an early tour on another day. The takeaway breakfast box contained an egg, jam, Egyptian bread, soft cheese, juice, and banana. We had a douwd pasha for dinner which was delicious, made with local items.

Both Ahmeds and all other staff members were extremely helpful and friendly.","Not negatives but things to note/areas for improvement:
- The bathroom follows traditional Nubian style without a separated shower area. You'll need to sweep water toward the drain, though the bathroom is well-ventilated. 
- Some lamps would make the room more ambient (there were a couple of dim lights in the room, but they weren't strong enough for reading). 
- Early dinner orders are recommended as kitchen preparation times can be lengthy. Last orders are taken by 9:45pm."

On the one hand, the ship's crew were amazing. You are well taken care of; they are friendly and helpful, and happy to help make your experience a pleasant one. They keep the facilities pristine, and seem to enjoy their work.","On the other hand... This is a very difficult company to work with. Communication with them is extremely difficult, and you only get responses if you are pushy. They don't seem overly flexible, and it seems that once they have your money, you're on your own. The ship's facilities are also mixed; some parts are beautiful, but there are also hot tubs without heat, and weight room equipment that doesn't work. You get nickel and dimed for things; I'm guessing that this is a budget cruise line that cuts corners this way, or just that this isn't high season, so things are allowed to lapse.
 Please fix these. However, please tell your guides.... Stop touching the ancient ruins and the remaining paintings on the walls! They don't wear gloves, and they rub their hands all along them... It irks me when tourists do that, and I have told people off for it, but for a group leader to do it; that's inexcusable. And it ruins the experience. Possibly the worst part of the experience, in my opinion - please respect your country's heritage. 
 So all in all, a very mixed review."

From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the beauty and charm of the place. The hostel itself is a true gem—its serene and cozy atmosphere made it the perfect retreat after a day of exploring. The design and decor are stunning, and every corner exudes a sense of warmth and comfort.

However, what truly set this hostel apart was the incredible hospitality provided by Jimmy and Bibs. These two are absolute gems! They went above and beyond to ensure I had everything I needed, always ready to lend a hand with a smile. Their kindness and friendliness made me feel right at home, and it was clear that they genuinely care about their guests. 

Additionally, they arranged fantastic trips to Abu Simbel and Philae Temple for me at an unbeatable price! Having everything so well-organized and affordable made my experience even more memorable.

Hostel is in the Aswan souk - if arriving at the railway station, turn left to enter the souk (pedestrian-only so no traffic to dodge or taxi drivers harassing you) and walk until you get to the T-junction. The entrance is diagonally left, a hidden alleyway between 2 clothing stores (circled in yellow). I stayed on the 4th floor, which was 2 dorm rooms and a third bedroom, with one shared bathroom. The lack of traffic was quite peaceful, the noise from the souk never bothered the girls dorm. You can rent towels and locks for the locker. Bunkbed has a privacy curtain, electrical outlet, and lamp. Form mattress and SOLID pillow. There’s a kitchen on the 5th floor. Biba arranged for a small group tour to Abu Simbel, the pickup point was a short walk from the hostel. Property was very clean, and I would definitely recommend it, I loved the location, the staff, and the peaceful nights sleep I got.","Others have commented on the 4 flights of stairs you have to walk up, and with your luggage they really are no joke. I recommend traveling light. Also, if the boys dorm is populated by slobs then the shared bathroom will probably get dire, but there’s cleaning supplies in the bathroom and MULTIPLE signs please asking guests to not be pigs so that’s on us guests, really"

The location is on the 3rd or 4th floor. So be prepare for the luggages. I herd, throug the grape vines, that an elevator is to be installed in the near future.

Upon arrival, you can tell right away that you will have a wonderful stay. Hosts are very welcoming, and the facility is well maintained. Tidy and comfortable.

Room #3 is facing the pedestrian street (souk), and you will hear noise coming from there. But, it's nothing to compare with Cairo (which is a good thing). So, bring your earplugs if you are a light sleeper (like me). I am convinced that this issue could be easily resolved with a creative solution toward the window.

Guests are respectful.

Hosts are sensible and attentive to your comfort and happiness.
