Hotel has a tie-up with Magic Carpet Travel company which arranged hot air balloon, felucca and day tours for us at good prices. Breakfast was a buffet selection with omelette station - a treat indeed. Hotel had a nice design concept. Most importantly, we made new friends from different countries and we really enjoyed discovering Luxor together!",No Negative Feedback

Fabulous restaurant, some of the best food we have eaten in Egypt and definitely the best Egyptian breakfast by far.
I have to say the staff are wonderful, very welcoming, always with a ready smile and incredible helpful. My only regret is we didn't stay longer. Definitely on my wishlist to go back.
Oh, and don't miss the beautiful sunsets from the terrace, it's amazing.","Nothing to complain about, the entrance is tucked away off the main street and is accessed from the entrance to the bazaar. Once inside it gets better and better so don't be put off by the entrance."

Jolie Ville Hotel & Spa Kings Island Luxor (Resort) (Egypt) Deals,Jolie Ville Hotel & Spa Kings Island Luxor,Sherine,Germany,3 nights · ,January 2025,Family,Deluxe Double or Twin Room with Garden View,"Reviewed: January 26, 2025","The gardens and huge spaces make it very relaxing to stay there. Each room has its little garden with two chairs and a table, you can take lengthy walks between the beautiful and unique trees or along the nile at the edge of the island, the plants are unique and exquisite. Three large pools, endless sunbeds and seating options throughout the huge gardens, activities for every age and every person whether a zoo for the children or kids play areas, spa with massages, aerobics and pilates classes, chess and fishing activities - so much to do at the hotel. The location is amazing as you’re in the middle of the nile away from the noise but at the same time it is very well connected to the city either via taxis that are lined up outside the hotel or 2 shuttle busses for free.","The food quality is not good. I stayed at this hotel several times before with my mother (booking was always under her name), and the thing we enjoyed the most was the food, it was delicious.
This time the experience was very disappointing. The variety itself is big and good, but the tase and quality are bad. The bread is very stale, three breakfasts and it was always stale as if it was bread from the previous days. At Dinner, the variety was not the best but it was okay-ish. The taste was again not good, the food is bland, a lot of seasoning is missing. We were very disappointed because Felucca Restaurant was one of our highlights, we loved the breakfast and dinner there everytime we stayed. This time it was not good at all. The Italian restaurant was good however."

"Steigenberger Resort Achti (Hotel), Luxor (Egypt) Deals",Steigenberger Resort Achti,Karen,Malaysia,3 nights · ,January 2025,Group,Superior Twin Plus Garden View (Bungalow),"Reviewed: February 2, 2025","One of my best stays in Egypt. The room was clean and spacious, and the staff were friendly, professional, and helpful. What I loved the most was their buffet-style breakfast, which was mostly Western with a few local options. I always started my day with a happy stomach here. The sunset and night views were perfect, and there were small live local band performances. Absolutely worth staying!","The only inconvenience I found was the room key. Sometimes it wouldn't work, and I had to reactivate it at the lobby. After asking about it, the staff informed us that the key shouldn't be placed near a cellphone or credit card. It would have been great if they had told us this during check-in, so we didn't have to walk all the way to reactivate it, especially since our room was quite far from the lobby. The WiFi worked perfectly fine in the lobby but not in the room. The air conditioner was old-school style—it worked great, but it didn’t have a heating option, so the nights were pretty chilly."

The staff are all very nice and accommodating, and the view from the hotel/garden is simply breath-taking - especially during the sunsets! The breakfast is also very good.","Just outside of the hotel is the parking for people that are driving horse carriages around town, and this makes the entrance of the hotel extremely dirty. It is really strange to see that the hotel is not addressing this by trying to clean at least a few meters outside of their hotel gates (we encountered a p*op in front of the entrance door of the hotel, and told the staff - and they did not seem interested in cleaning this, because we saw the same poop after we can back too - with footprints around it, as someone stepped in it in between)."
