Sharm-ElSheikh,Gündüz,Excellent,"Everything was perfect, all hotel crews are so kind. Meals are prepared to appeal to all people. I loved!",No Negative Review
Sharm-ElSheikh,Mandy,unbelievable relaxation experience,"impeccable cleanliness with the manager checking regularly with spot checks. the staff were unreal in their desire to make your stay amazing. constantly asking if you need anything. as 1guest put it....they treat you like it's the first day of the season...every day. I would say....they treat you like you're the only guest in the resort every day. posh club is just the best holiday experience I have ever had. when we complained about our room overlooking some building works that were ongoing....we were moved immediately and sent flowers every day afterwards. posh club dining is equivalent to any Michelin star restaurant you can mention. we ate there every night. just 

fabulous.",posh club should be adults only although kids were well behaved. in the adult only pool areas....children were sometimes allowed in until I complained and said I would report to their manager. main restaurant...loads of choice but noisy and bit like a cafe at night. same for indian and small portions there too.
Sharm-ElSheikh,Alaere,Exceptional,"The resort is beautiful, and the vibe is exciting. The staff were welcoming and ensured my stay was relaxing. I will definitely visit in the near future.",No Negative Review
Sharm-ElSheikh,Elena,Wonderful,"Beautiful sea and location, comfortable and picturesque passage to the sea through a row of terraces. Natural landscape protects the beach from the wind. Well maintained cute garden. Good buffet choice caters to various tastes. Spacious rooms.",Restaurant service is not extraordinary. The choice of alcohol drinks and cocktails leaves much to be desired.
Sharm-ElSheikh,Hannah,Unforgettable stay due to the Posh Club team!,"Our stay at White Hills Resort is one we’ll never forget. We are so glad that we paid extra for Posh Club as the staff here made our holiday so special! The restaurant manager Mohammed and all his team were incredible, our butlers Tamer and Ahmed looked after us so well, the barman Abdel made the best cocktails and Louela and Nada made sure everything with our stay went smoothly. When my husband got ill they made special food and brought it to the room and on my birthday they made a cake and put flowers in our room! When we booked a 4am trip to the pyramids they made sure we had breakfast boxes and took us to meet the pick up van. We have never experienced such a wonderful team of staff on any other holiday ever, thank you!!

The hotel itself was beautiful and very clean and all the staff were so friendly. We had a swim up room with an ocean view and it was amazing! Our room was cleaned every day to a high standard and our fridge filled. We loved all the little touches in the room - flowers, sweet treats, full fridge etc. Anything we needed our butler Tamer sorted right away - extra hangers, different pillow, iron and board etc, we had everything! 

We ate at all the included restaurants and Posh Club was our favourite however the Indian and Asian were amazing!! Don’t miss these out! The Mediterranean was good for lunch and nice beach location. The beach was very busy during our stay as it was the school holidays so we chilled by our swim up each day.

The entertainment was okay with lots of variety, some of the dance shows were really good. We really enjoyed the live music at Posh Club each night, very chilled vibes. 

Overall our stay was truly magical and we will definitely be back in the future! Hotel managers - you have got an absolutely brilliant team at Posh Club, make sure you look after them because they are doing the most fantastic job, you are lucky to have them!!","The only negative things I’d say about our stay was the buffet restaurant was much too overcrowded (you were literally fighting for a table when it opened on some nights) and lots of the food was either overcooked or cold depending on the time you went. The staff on the door need to stop letting people in when it’s full because we couldn’t even get a table one night. 

We were also disappointed to find out two of the restaurants (Turkish and Seafood) weren’t included in the all inclusive package which is very strange considering it’s called an all inclusive hotel. We’ve never experienced this before in any 5* all inclusive resorts we’ve stayed in. These restaurants were always virtually empty too so it seems like a waste. 

Other than this our stay was perfect!"
Sharm-ElSheikh,Khalid,Very Good,"The staff, food were great, service was amazing","Insect in the room was annoying, fire alarm was giving false alarm 3-4 times, specially at night while sleeping"
Sharm-ElSheikh,Dominika,Exceptional,Tamer and all staff is amazing. Posh Club is fantastic. Thank you so much everything. You work so hard. ♡,No Negative Review
Sharm-ElSheikh,Rawan,Good day,"The resort was clean and view was amazing , enjoyed the activities they had and the we tried only the indian restaurant and was reaallly good , make sure to try it . I liked the ocean it was like crystal .","- the gulf car always late though it’s 5 stations only .
- there was diversity in breakfast but didn’t like any.
- one day we were prepared based on the activity schedule but suddenly it changed . It was a bit disappointing."
Sharm-ElSheikh,Osama,Exceptional,"Privacy and safety, activities, stuff, food, and facilities, but let me say that it's about the professional management team doing a great job from the back of seen to keep figuring all things up , about hospitality they're they master's",Maybe nothing

Sharm-ElSheikh,Aiga,Wonderful,"Sea, sun, great staff, and Oksana geast relations and Oksana animation team were amazing. we will come back","Hotel did not have baby potty. However, cleaning team went out and about and bought us one. that for us - doors keys were not up to scratch"
Sharm-ElSheikh,Ibrahim,worth the stay,"The layout of place is stunning. As soon as you go out of the main hotel towards the rooms, it's like a pretty Italian style village. very classy and comfortable.

The Roman pool was fantastic to swim in. the gardens are excellent, the place is generally clean through out. 

the sun decking area is great. different levels to relax and enjoy the sun and sea. 

because there isn't a beach you have to walk over the coral via a floating bridge and then jump into the sea. and you can start snorkeling straight away. we saw blue spotted sting ray plus many other amazing fishes. the water is so clear, clean and beautiful.

you can organise and start your activities from there too. 

the food is fine. beef and the kebabs were my favourite. someone to make your omelette the way you like and plenty to choose from. 

I got a great massage in the spa. sold by Osama and Ahmed was my masseuse. he did good. 

customer service was very good throughout the trip. 
do give a tip to the waiters etc. 

I found out later they had a family room, I will use that next time I come with kids. Ahmed Ibrahim was a very nice friendly manager.","Location is far from the main road. like 3km before you see shops. the area is getting developed. so to go to other areas you'll need a taxi. hotel is convenient, haggle but still expensive. once you get to town you can take numbers of other drivers or download in-drive app another UK tourist advised me. 

I'm not a fan of bath tubs and curtains. the shower and the curtain can be updated.

the mattress can also be updated too. but it was still clean and comfortable to sleep in. 

ground floor rooms have a lot of mosquitos. ask reception for help in this. the WiFi is very expensive, your better off getting an Egyptian SIM card. it's so much cheaper and much better. I think I paid 10€ for 13GB data to last a month. the hotel charges $20 for WiFi only.

In fact, the hotel is very beautiful, with interesting architectural ideas and interior design, but requires investment in renovation or/and general cleaning.
The hotel staff is very polite and helpful. Many thanks to the receptionists and their boss for their responsiveness and great service!
It is worth to mention that croissants and sweets were amazing)","-Too firm pillows and matresses
-Unsanitary conditions in the restaurant and especially in the tea/coffee area
-No variety of dishes for people with dietary requirements 
-Dirty curtains spoil the overall appearance of the room and make you reluctant to touch them
- Be prepared to fight mosquitos("

Sharm-ElSheikh,Federica,Exceptional,"We both come from the hotel industry and hospitality and are more than satisfied with Meraki!! We had the pleasure of staying at this establishment recently, and it was an absolutely wonderful experience!

First and foremost, the atmosphere was simply amazing. There’s something special about the way they’ve created such a relaxing and enjoyable environment that stands out. All the staff is super welcoming, always smiley and helpfull! They went above and beyond to ensure all our needs were met. You can feel everyone just loves to work here, which is very rare to see.

The place was very clean. Everything from the rooms, to the restaurants, common areas and pools, have been cleaned every single day and all day long!!

The food was very good!! Every meal was delicious, fresh, and thoughtfully prepared, making dining here an absolute highlight.

The hotel is really well located, 10 minutes by car from the airport.

Great see view, with incredible sunrises and sunsets. The hotel is located directly in front of the beautiful coral reef, amazing for snorkel and also diving.

After check-out we could stay all day long at the hotel, and still get all the all-inclusive amenities for no extra charge. That's something we really appreciated.

A big thank you goes to the people that made our stay really incredible.

Ahmed Gamal, the kind and professional waiter from Munchery. We ate almost everyday here only to get his good service!!

Eslam the friendly baarkeeper in the lobby bar!!

Ahmed from the housekeeping, he always greeted us with a big smile and made sure we always had everything. Cleaned our room everyday in a impeccable way!!

The entertainment guys, are just amazing!! They involved us in different activities, games, shows and nights out. Ahmed, Kareem, Mohamed and Tony had us laugh all day long!

Overall, this place is truly special. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an unforgettable experience.
We'll definitely be returning as soon as possible!!",No Negative Review

We read the negative reviews and booked anyway as it had amazing price and location (beach front). We were amazed by the room we stayed in! It had a roof with a pool and sea view. It was very clean, and the furniture was in great condition, unlike previous reviews. There were recent renovations.
All in all, I would definitely visit again.","Since it was off-season, dinner was not open-buffet but rather unlimited set-menu. It was understandable as there were not many guests. Breakfast was open-buffet though.
So if you want open-buffet dinner, make sure to visit in-season (the summer or during the winter break)."

Tobacco/Cigarette shop 24 hours (a 20 pack costs about 120 ep so about £1.50) different alcohol shops like “Drinkies” and others (a big can of delicious local beer Stella is around 50 ep). You then have the “Enab Restaurant”. Beautiful decor with a water feature and ambience. Wonderful food (I ate here everyday of my stay) and amazing prices.

The apartment is super clean and very comfortable. You have privacy and it is very secure with lock to gate and front door plus very safe family friendly quite residential area. You have a comfortable double bed which can be separated to 2 singles if needed. L shaped sofa plus wifi, kitchen area with all cooking/ utensils, huge fridge.

Sharm-ElSheikh,Uzgel,Overall recommended,"I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Our renovated room was cozy, comfortable, and offered a stunning sea view. The food was enjoyable, and the private beach with its reef provided an unforgettable experience for us. If I were to visit Sharm again, I would choose this hotel without hesitation.

Given the number of Turkish guests at the hotel, having Turkish-speaking staff would be nice. Nonetheless, the staff was very helpful. A special thanks to Roma for organizing our transfers to the city center, the old town, and the airport—his service was seamless and the drivers were friendly and proficient in English.

I particularly enjoyed the à la carte restaurants, especially the Lebanese restaurant, although I found its name, “Mandarine,” a bit puzzling.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel, if you don’t mind a few minor inconveniences.","there are areas for improvement. The provided amenities were insufficient and of poor quality, so I recommend bringing your own toiletries for your comfort. Additionally, the absence of free Wi-Fi is a significant drawback for a five-star hotel—you have to pay for internet access."
Sharm-ElSheikh,Jankov,Exceptional,The hotel is situated at the beach with beautiful coral reef. Facilities as expected for a 5* hotel.,No Negative Review
Sharm-ElSheikh,Sharon,Good,"Snorkling in the corals on this beach
Good selection of food
The complex and swimming pools","Only allowed to use one bar and it was awful, no oxygen, dark and dingy, badly decorated and a cattle market of people.
The other 2 bars you had to be ultra all inclusive to use, one was dark and dingy the other nice but no one was in them. Everyone would fit in all 3 bar areas people need variety."
Sharm-ElSheikh,Ahmed,Very Good,"Management response are agile & very responsive, staff are nice & helpful, beach are very safe, food is very clean & tasty",The facility needs some minor renovation on outdoor areas for example some walkways

Sharm-ElSheikh,Omer,Very Good,"Excellent room design, nice garden, clean and modern bathroom and building. 10/10 rooms
Also I admired the beach beds and umbrellas. Bravo
Middle garden was breathtaking","Food and wifi. Honestly such a great building should have been complete with food and wifi. Waiters can be nicer and kinder as well.
Wifi is quite limited on rooms and restaurants, it was such a low speed which can only afford WhatsApp texting. If you have a picture that takes 50kb it takes several minutes to download. 
and on the beach no wifi at all."
Sharm-ElSheikh,Takafumi,Good,"When I faced a trouble, Ahmed Ismail, who is front office manager, helped me and solved the problem! Appreciate him.",Wi-fi was really weak and it was not improved even when I asked the front desk. There's no bath robe in the room. Key was not working properly sometime. The room was so far from the front desk and sometimes you lost your way.

Sharm-ElSheikh,Andreea,Not 5 * hotel!!,"The beach is small but very nice, suitable for children or people that can't swim. The employees trying their best to solve the issues. The minibar filled every day with water, small boxes of juice and waffers.Bed sheets changed 2 times in 7 days","Long lines of people on beach bar, long time of waiting for a car ( 3 cars only for a big resort), mosquitoes in the rooms, the quality of food( most cheap ingredients, cheese, salami...), coffee is a cheap brand of Nescafe, juices are Tang mixed with water, no bathrobe or slippers, clogged pipes for showers, lack of employees, Panorama bar is not inclusive"

Receptionist team during our stay 4th-11th of November were incredibly helpful, kind, and welcoming throughout our visit. The hotel itself is very big and divided on 3 parts which gives more space for everyone and doesn't make human interaction with each other to tight. Restaurant was very good, a big variety of food every evening and staff there created an unforgettable experience! Room was spacious and comfortable! The seaside area was expansive, with ample space for everyone to enjoy. We loved diving right from our beach to see the sunken boat—a real highlight!The DJ set on the Hotels Disco night was awesome! Definitely will return next time!","The lock on our room door was old and didn't always work properly. However, the animation program could use some improvement. While the staff were friendly, the overall program felt weak, with limited options for activities. We’re hoping to see a more engaging and varied program on our next visit!"

Hotel has huge beautiful and very maintained territory. Our room was very clean, and housekeeper Mohammed always managed to clean it when we were out.

Sharm-ElSheikh,Nicola,Gorgeous peaceful place.,The view was astonishing. The staff were all really nice. It was very peaceful. The food was great!,Still some teething issues. Plumbing. The area is under major construction. The sea isn’t easy to access at all. Mosquitos are very bad here.
Sharm-ElSheikh,รื่นเริง,👍🏼,"Of course, the view was perfect nice staff, I’d met Ashraf, overall is nice the staff are well serviced. I hope those family of the black cat growing up well also 😍","Sometimes the food have less choice of the option in the Menu, for the breakfast have only 1 thing out of 3 to choose, so that’s kind of boring if you stay many day with the same menu of food. Hope you prepare it well next time!"
Sharm-ElSheikh,Jukka-pekka,Good,Desent place for The Price. Outside hotel looks nice. Staff was nice.,The hotel room's bathroom is not tidy. the sheets on the bed look dirty. there are no sheets in the blanket. Hard to get to coral reef. No jetty.
Sharm-ElSheikh,Gavin,Very Good,"near the water, quiet, nice staff. i was only there for one night but would have stayed longer if i could",curtains in the room didn't block out light very well. aircon was blowing straight onto me in bed.
Sharm-ElSheikh,Simone,I stayed only one night and wished I had stayed longer.,"Really lovely setup - right by the sea, you can just walk off the beach into a coral reef. The pool area is amazing, chilled coffee house vibes and music. The staff are so friendly and helpful, always with a smile. Breakfast was so yum and filling. I would mention that it's only cash and no atm nearby but they take a lot of currencies.",Shower was leaky.
Sharm-ElSheikh,Denise,The name Serenity Lodge is program.,"This place is pure magic💫. If you are looking for a place to relax, to snorkel in a peaceful and colorful environment or to come together with likeminded people or to talk about the universe, then you are the right place! The personnel is beyond friendly and very eager to help you in any situation possible. The owner is also very, very friendly and helpful. 

They have their own taxi drivers and even though Serenity Lodge is a bit further away from those busy areas, it's absolutely worth it. The prices are also very fair.

PS: They just built a very cool and cosy area next to the pool where you can work as a digital nomad! They even have charging stations on the pillars of the whole construction - it´s just amazing!","Id o not have any negative points, just two things I´d probably do in the near future.

I´d only put some seating furniture on the balcony, a table and two chairs for those who need to work in the room and some plants in the rooms to make it more cosy, but I think its already in the making. 

And I´d add the Egyptian Salads (Mezze) that you get in any restaurant to the menu. They are so delicious and it is really great if you don't need to go out for that (but this is just a very personal thing cause I could eat this from dust till dawn) 😁"
Sharm-ElSheikh,Siveen,Nice & quiet place for relaxation,Didnt have the chance to try the breakfast but the location is amazing .,"Security they were super rude . Unbelievabley rude . 
I had to get into a fight because one of them was so rude and wouldnt make a proper convo kept shouting till smw from my friends lied about giving the other one money so he could just leave us alone ! This is one situation of our stay ."

They have cashed a higher price."
Sharm-ElSheikh,Guangcong,Budget accomodation near Naama Bay,"All the staff are very kind, located walking distance to Naama Bay, at least when it's not too hot. Very economical option","The facilities are very old, staff are doing their best to maintain it, but there is just that much one can do. Standard room has window open to corridor, so one probably will have it covered most of time."
Sharm-ElSheikh,Hicham,Very Good,near to everything,all good
Sharm-ElSheikh,Ahmed,Pleasant,#NAME?,"- Food taste and varieties 

- Cleaness 

- Beach is far from the hotel, you have to walk under 50 degree temperature and the sun above your head for 12 minutes to reach the beach. I don't know why the hotel is not providing shuttle bus from hotel to beach and vice versa

- usually no available places on the beach ."
Sharm-ElSheikh,Ahmed,Pleasant,"Good value for money, the oriental coffee ahop owner is the best thing about this hotel, very hospitable and the prces are very reasonable.","Slow check in process,

Lobby was very hot
Lunch and breakfast minimal no boiled eggs no hot drinks in dinner for half board drinks are awful ... . Beach is 1km walk with no free transportation and needs to take tickets daily from reception, the beach also denies food and drink from outside.

Sharm-ElSheikh,Dancho,Great place to visit with your family,"It was my first all-inclusive stay, and I was surprised by how good it was. I was able to see the chefs how they prepare the food on the spot. A pizza guy was making the dough and baking the pizza. The fish guy, was grilling fish and sea food on the spot. And there was soo much food to chose from that it was hard.

Beach is really nearby, it has a shuffle bus, but personally I've never used it, although I was with a 4-year baby. It is really nearby. 

The room was big, and with a view to the sea. It was cleaned daily, and it had space for cloths, and other stuff.

In the lobby, it had shops, but also Taxi desk, where you can ask for personal transfer anywhere - whether it is a short travel, or day-tour

The bay is WOW - you can snorkel and see reefs and a variety of fishes. 

The pools are also fantastic - they have aquapark sliders, that we really enjoyed.","The beach is on rocks. So it is not really baby-friendly. But if you use the bay, you can immediately look at fishes. 

The prices for boat tours, and taxi travels are overpriced. We've realized this after we left, and tried other companies - it was like x2 or x3 than regular prices for tours. But this is normal in most of resorts."
Sharm-ElSheikh,Husna,Lovely location and professional staff,"The hotel is well-located and the interiors are amazing. The staff were friendly and professional. 

We had a small issue with a restaurant’s reservation but was solved by Ahmed from the front desk to accomodate our desire.",There might be a variety of food but the quality and taste need to be improved.

Sharm-ElSheikh,Lukasz,Friendly staff and decent value for small money,"Staff was friendly. Room was ok although you could close the main doors while doors from the ground floor balcony were not closing so room could be left open as well. Waiters in the restaurant were super helpful and friendly. 

Room size and bed were ok. Bathroom, towels were clean to decent degree. 

Restaurant offered vast selection of meals while not very tasty. 

All in all , whole men staff was trying to do their best while I reckon men's way of cleaning is not the premium.



But much much better than other 4☆☆☆☆ hotel with low price (Sharm Cliff Hotel) which was purely disaster. 

By comparison Falcon Hills is much better.","All meals feeled the same for few days.
