Polly,Hotel for overnight,"The hotel looks as a place to stay for a night before your flight or going to another destination. The reception works 24/7, room was big and no noice from neighbours.","Outside area is under construction, dogs were barking from the early morning. I‚Äôm not sure about proper hygiene of the room and beds and towels. Towels looked old, hard and yellowish instead of white. Breakfast was very poor, plates and cups were broken. We didn‚Äôt risk to eat much."

Qing,All good. Small beach area of the hotel was okay. The sea view was amazing.,The sea view directly from the hotel room was spectacular.,The hotel reception refused to provide free water for the second night.
