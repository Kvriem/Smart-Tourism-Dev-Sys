Mohamed helped us booking a tour to Abu Simbel, nothing pushy just explaining our options.

         "1. I Paid extra for deluxe swim up pool room leading off my veranda but pool was freezing and not heated, very disappointed as the sun only hit the pool around 7am and by 9am onward it was in the shade and air temperature only 22c at that time so wasn't tempted to use my swim up pool and waste of extra money paid. Swim up room pools should be heated especially in winter month of January, February when air tempreture is chilly to use a cold unheated pool.\r\n\r\n2. Only 2 pools heated out of 10 pools in the entire complex and small children were using the adult pools also. More pools should be heated so children can stay in their own pool and adults can be in other pools instead of the whole hotel guests adults and children trying to squeeze into only 2 adult heated pools whilst the other 8 pools were empty as too cold to enter.\r\n\r\n3.Indoor heated pool in Spa area closed at 5pm? But should stay open until atleast 6.30pm as the spa is still open until 7pm and has staff in there. \r\nMaybe split the lifeguard shifts so they have a lifeguard to cover until 7pm also in the indoor pool as sunset should not affect the indoor pool which has lights and is heated. \r\n\r\n4. The ala carte restaurant doesn't have a printed menu, they just bring you starter , mains and desert without telling you what's in the ingredients unless you ask and some of the waiters still didn't know if was gluten, or lactose or what other allergies . I couldn't eat mushroom due to allergy but it was mixed up in the beef dish and looked like a piece of beef but luckily I detected it in the first mouthful and spat it out with out manners as it made me gag, i couldn't touch the beef dish thereafter.",

Mohamed helped us booking a tour to Abu Simbel, nothing pushy just explaining our options. Would also recommend booking a tour via Mohamed, since it’s all very well organized with a boat trip straight from the hotel. They also prepared for us a take away breakfast for our Abu Simbel trip.

Mohamed helped us booking a tour to Abu Simbel, nothing pushy just explaining our options.
