They were clean but very used, dirty walls, doors, mirrors, corners, rust and shower head literally fell apart in my hands while I was showering, I regret not taking a picture of it. I put it together somehow and it worked but it shouldn’t have happened and that’s a big shame. Food I would say was also just ok, breakfast as well just ok, in terms of taste and freshness. Another point is SPA. Insanely overpriced and extremely mediocre, I was hugely disappointed with my massage (she checked her phone while massaging, probably for the time but I found it unprofessional and never happened to me in other hotels) and massage itself was not so great, not anything special it was just ok, my boyfriend could do the same but for almost 200$ it shouldn’t be that way. I was expecting something amazing as well for seeing all those awards all over the place. I will leave my honest review here since I didn’t say that to the staff when asked how was my treatment, my boyfriend was next to me and he gifted me this massage so i said it was good because I didn’t want him to feel bad for doing something nice for me. I do not recommend.",-1

They were clean but very used, dirty walls, doors, mirrors, corners, rust and shower head literally fell apart in my hands while I was showering, I regret not taking a picture of it. I put it together somehow and it worked but it shouldn’t have happened and that’s a big shame. Food I would say was also just ok, breakfast as well just ok, in terms of taste and freshness. Another point is SPA. Insanely overpriced and extremely mediocre, I was hugely disappointed with my massage (she checked her phone while massaging, probably for the time but I found it unprofessional and never happened to me in other hotels) and massage itself was not so great, not anything special it was just ok, my boyfriend could do the same but for almost 200$ it shouldn’t be that way. I was expecting something amazing as well for seeing all those awards all over the place. I will leave my honest review here since I didn’t say that to the staff when asked how was my treatment, my boyfriend was next to me and he gifted me this massage so i said it was good because I didn’t want him to feel bad for doing something nice for me.

They were very expensive and the guides were not good. In one case I had a very bad experience. The guides don’t know much, they rush you through the sites and to the souvenir shops (which are company owned)",-1

We went in the summer (off-peak) so perhaps they did not have enough customers to justify a wider variety of food. But it was still ok.

The tours were average for the high price. We took many tours (from Viator) beforehand in Cairo and felt that we paid much less for similar tours.",-1

A kettle in the room would be good.

I live in Egypt and quite savvy to the street hustles but got scammed by a worker from the boat who saw me on the street and said 'hi'. I only wanted directions to a pharmacy but of course i got 'guided' to his local spice shop and scammed into paying way over the odds for teas i didn't want/ need and then he asked for more baksheesh (tips) on top. Not ok. Not professional. Left a bit of a bad taste.",-1
