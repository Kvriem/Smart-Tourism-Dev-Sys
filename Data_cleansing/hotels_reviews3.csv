"Charming Miramar Aparthotel (Condo Hotel), Alexandria (Egypt) Deals",Charming Miramar Aparthotel,Micmakes,Italy,1 night · ,August 2023,Group,Two-Bedroom Apartment,"Reviewed: September 11, 2023","The host directed us to a different location, but some pictures were related to the place we were in, so we thought there was a problem with Arabic-English translation and we accepted to stay. 
After the cash payment, the hotel guy asked to take a picture of my Booking.com reservation on my mobile, justifying it with the need to fulfill local tourism rules: my BIG MISTAKE because he grabbed also my reservation PIN.
The apartment was dirty, and clearly not cleaned after a previous stay. There was a water leak in the pipe of the sink. 
The power went away because the host didn't charge the counter, so the building doorman fixed the problem after some calls.
Finally, the Wi-Fi was not present.
It was very late, we stayed there only one night, planning to leave very early. So we thought to manage our complaints the day after.
Left the keys on the door, while traveling again, we discovered the Booking.com reservation was canceled, without any chance to leave feedback. 
Thanks to Booking.com's customer care I understood the host canceled the reservation with my PIN, impersonating me. WHY? maybe this way prevents us from leaving (bad) feedback? maybe this way they don't pay Booking.com fees?
I don't really know, but finally, Booking.com gave us the opportunity to write this review, alerting other potential customers, and hoping the host to improve its offer, and avoid behaving dishonestly.

Note: My vote was not ""1"" because we booked late that day, after a long trip, while was very difficult to arrange a stay at that time in Alexandria.","The host directed us to a different location, but some pictures were related to the place we were in, so we thought there was a problem with Arabic-English translation and we accepted to stay.

"Charming Miramar Aparthotel (Condo Hotel), Alexandria (Egypt) Deals",Charming Miramar Aparthotel,Hamada,Saudi Arabia,4 nights · ,August 2023,Family,Apartment with Sea View,"Reviewed: August 30, 2023",Location - Air Conditioner quality but it is available only in 2 rooms,"It is the worst experience you might have. Photos will explain it and no need for further words, but let me put few points:
Furniture including Sofa, Beds, Mattresses are very old and Dirty and not comfortable at all.
Property manager doesn't have any kind of hospitality and good relationship with guests and for any issue, he blames it on you.
You can imagine they allow you for 25 EGP electricity consumption per day, and you need to pay for further consumption. In my case, Electricity got off in my first day at 3 AM, and the guy said it seems I have high consumption and I need to control it, and he asked me to go down at the parking area to wake up the building guard and ask him to recharge the electricity credit!
The living room and one bed room don't have Air conditioner nor good fan, and there is only small fan and you need to make use of it if you need to utilize the living room and that bedroom.
WiFi is not working as there is issue with the service provider, however I doubt this and it seems to me they don't have the service at all and the modem is just installed there as decoration based on my experience with them.
Basic things are not available. For example there is no Trash Basket. Tea Boiler is not working and when I aksed the guy to resolve this, he said I will send you one guy to help, and no one showed up for the whole 4 nights.
The apartment is under different brand ""Makseem"", and they don't give you a receipt for the payment.
Kitchen is very dirty as per the photos.
Lighting is very low, even the entrance is dark with no light at all, and you need to use your phone lighter to be able to get in even in the day time.
It is not safe, as you will see broken glass in one of the photos.
No Clean Service at all
They canceled my booking however I paid the full amount in cash in first day.
 same company has couple of places and not recommended to book any apartment under their management."

2- There is no mobile network coverage inside the apartment.
3- The attitude of Abanoub was like he is doing me a favor especially when I complained that the wifi is not working. I was not happy the way it was handled.
When I told him that I would complain to booking.com, he came to fix it.
4- blankets, bedsheets, pillowcase were dirty.
5- there was no even a dustbin in the apartment.
6- the photos don't match the real status of the apartment.
7- The location is great but the GPS location provided in booking.com was wrong, so I have to walk up and down to find the right building."

"ZAFERO POREFAG- Families only (Apartment), Alexandria (Egypt) Deals",ZAFERO POREFAG- Families only,Aya,Egypt,3 nights · ,March 2022,Family,Apartment with Sea View,"Reviewed: March 16, 2022",The veiw is breathtaking. All utilities work fine,"It was freezing cold, the place isn't cold proof at all, barely any wood that isnt MDF and zero carpets to keep it warm. The windows dont fully seal shut and the smallest bit of air is enough to make the whole apartment even closer. They knew it was cold at this time of the year, yet they don't put any carpets on, they leave one just ONE blanket on each bed in a place on the 12th floor facing the sea! The beds were cold to set on, quite illogical, I had to request more blankets. No heating in the place, The ACs are only cold. This place is good for warm weather but in winter, its not ready. I have stayed in cheaper places in winter before and they brought a heater and a comforter. 

Also the communication was bad. I said I was approaching in 15 minutes yet they still sent someone 20 mins late while we stood outside in the cold waiting. And when I left I nearly took the keys back home as my ride was here and they didn't send someone to pick the keys up yet and when they did, she didn't even find us when we gave her all signs, we found her after wasting 30 minutes making our driver furious."
